Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes
Growing up fast didn’t slow her down
American child in her baby blue gown
Her bedroom was pink ‘til she turned three
She liked the feel of her baby blue sheets
Neighbors stared at the one horse lie
Of a little girl with blue on her mind

Thought of green when she was feeling blue
American child in her baby blue boots
She was an archangel, sweet danger
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

Eighteen, small scene
Here, our love was a beauty unseen
Living life young, she’d never get bored
When Hank came around in his beat-up Ford
Prom night came with a blue corsage
Had the car waxed at Ben’s Garage
Told her he loved her and meant nothing less
To a baby-blonde girl in a baby blue dress
He reached over and kissed her hand
Five years later came a brand-new, baby blue wedding band

She was a romantic, taking chances
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

Married two years, Hank was an engineer
She would just stay home, soon-to-be mom
Every night they’d sit on the front porch
Waiting for the brand-new, brand-new baby to come

She was a newcomer, lullaby hummer
Counting her blessings and living for love
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved her new baby, Blue
Her brand-new baby, Blue
Her newborn baby, Blue

Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyesEmbed
