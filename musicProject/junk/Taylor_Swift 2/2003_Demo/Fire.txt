Asking you questions is like asking for lies
"Won't happen no more"
Yeah, I’ve heard that before

Runnin' round in circles isn't my game
I tried to make it work but I end up getting burnt

By the fire
Leading on a life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should’ve learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Giving you answers to my trivial heart
It's hard to break the chains that I can't pull apart

Runnin' round in circles ain't nobody's game
I tried to make it work but I keep up getting hurt

By the fire
Leading on a life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it’s my turn
To try to put out your fire

Your flames
Oh, they’re putting me out
The smoke
Can't see my way out
The heat, the heartache, the 
The eyes, the cries, and shattered lies

Tryna put out your fire
Leading on a life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should’ve learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire
Tryna put out your
Tryna put out your fireEmbed
