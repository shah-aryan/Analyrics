Think of an angel tonight
Think of something, my baby
'Cause everyone needs something to believe in
Somebody’s watching you tonight
You'll never know it now
But you're that one that they can’t live, live without

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

And think of beginnings tonight
Believe in so much more than you can ever try to imagine
And look at the sunset tonight
Believe in something that's greater than your tiny world
Or broken heart

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on

Some people waste it all looking for heaven
Maybe there's heaven, but what if
What if this is that heaven we're waiting for?
Buddy, you don't know
You'll never know

Baby, I'm watching you tonight
You never saw it before
But you're that one that I can’t live without
And I could go with you tonight
But love is a one-sided street
Don’t know and I'm not brave enough to find out

As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
