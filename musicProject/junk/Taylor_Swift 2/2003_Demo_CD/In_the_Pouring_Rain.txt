I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!

But, in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight

Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mindEmbed
