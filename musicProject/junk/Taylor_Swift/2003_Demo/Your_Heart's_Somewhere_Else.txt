3 ContributorsYour Heart’s Somewhere Else Lyrics
I used to know everything you were thinking
But now I just know you’re thinking ‘bout someone else but me
I count the days, I count the words you say
I need to know you’re alive and hoping I’ll be by your side
Can’t help but think that I’m driving you away
Don’t let me think it’s real, don’t make me think you’ll stay

I don’t know if you’re with me
I know you’re standing here
I always turn around just to know you’re there
And I deny it
Here, I’m crying
It’s hard to tell myself
Your heart’s somewhere else

I see you now, I don’t see happinеss
Don’t want to hold you back but I still want you for myself
You look around, do you like the things you see?
You’rе in a cage but I can’t stand to let you free
I can’t help but know that I’m driving you away
Don’t let me think your love won’t someday go away

I don’t know if you’re with me
I know you’re standing here
Sometimes I turn around to see if you’re still there
And I deny it
Here inside, I’m crying
It’s hard to tell myself
Your heart’s somewhere else

I never thought your eyes would lose their happiness
I know the longer you stay, the more you love me less

I don’t know if you’re with me
I know you’re standing here
I always turn around just to know you’re there
And I deny it
I am crying
It’s hard to tell myself
Your heart’s somewhere else
Your heart’s somewhere else
Your heart’s somewhere elseEmbed
