Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like it's no point hopin' at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh
You might also like
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you somethin', but you gave me nothin'
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (Fit, babe) wherever (Wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (I don't wanna fit, fit, babe) wherever (Wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (Home)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (Back, woah)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (I don't wanna fit)

I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (Back home to you, baby)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
Until you come back home77Embed
