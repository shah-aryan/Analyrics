105 ContributorsPricey Lyrics
Reach for my dog 'fore his shit get dicey
Shinin’ now, you never seen a clique get icy
Watchin' my step, tryna look just like me
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit—

Uh
Climbed up out the trenches as a shorty with intentions
To switch my whip as much as Rick and Morty switch dimensions
Never really known for dressin' gaudy, bitch, ’cause listen
Where I'm from, the bullets feed the ones that's starvin' for attention
She say, "He hella smart, I would've sworе he went to Princeton"
Not quitе, but it's the school of life that taught me death prevention
That's why I barely panic when the hammers, they be blammin'
No mechanics, but they snuck inside the party with the wrenches
I think fast ’cause niggas that be tardy get detention
Your soul lookin’ down over your body in suspension
The critics, they be on me, but they all be disingenuous
Bitch, I came up 'round addiction, seen like forty interventions
Your shit ain’t addin' up, know you a phoney, checked your image
Rappin' tough, but all them niggas in your audience is bitches
And white boys mostly, niggas know a verse from Cole be like a signed Michael Jordan rookie card in mint condition
The farthest thing from harbor shit, be honest with me, listen
You know if I want it, I be John Gotti with the henchmen
Right? I mean, it's simple math, a bit of cash can get a nigga bag
But that don’t make you big and bad, just mean you rich and mad
Nigga, your pillow soft, so kill the boss talk
Me to you's a cyanide pill to a lil' cough drop
This the Ville, filled of hard knocks, they sellin' hard rock
More plugs than these niggas use to fill a bald spot
And kill 'em all and fill a morgue up
I got bars forever, nigga, never will a call drop
No hammer like a mall cop
Still the hardest nigga on the planet earth from January first until the ball drop
You might also like
Yeah, he climbed out the great Ville, that's gangster
He missed meals to make mills, that's gangster
Then came back and gave back, that's gangster
Same chick from way back, he's gangster
Reach for my dog 'fore his shit get dicey
Shinin' now, you never seen a clique get icy
Watchin' my step, tryna look just like me
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try

Uh, just hit the paper and roll you a spliff, I'm lit, bitch, I'm lit
Just like the Vegas strip, blowin' through chips, I'm rich, bitch, I'm rich
David Chapelle on his latest Netflix
Go 'head, try to cancel my shit
I'll still be on stage with my hand on my dick
Seventeen thousand all jammin' my hits
These are ridiculous times
Lately, my biggest addiction been lookin' online
Where somebody's always offended, I'm sick of this cryin'
Niggas is dyin', victims of time
Self-inflicted, we sick in the mind
What's with the gossip? If you really handled your business, then you wouldn't have so much interest in mines
Breakin' news, I've officially entered my prime
Which is real interesting, this is the point where a rapper would typically start to decline
Somehow I climbed
Right when you thought I was fine, we're runnin' a little behind
Nipsey was tryin' to tell you this a marathon
Only listen to Minister Farrakhan
Oh my God, it just hit me, it's terrifyin'
I'm a star like the shit on the sheriff sign
If time was really money, I could purchase like two thousand bricks with my spare time
All praises due to my God
Dark days is too far behind
I part ways with the struggle, my hustle gon' always keep the squad paid
All labor, no off days 'cause the money don't sleep
And due to the focus, I couldn't even go broke if I spend like five hundred a week
And talk is cheap, I got a short receipt, can tell by your heart, you're weak
One thing 'bout this money, it's easy to get it, but trust me, my nigga, it's hard to keep
Yeah, he climbed out the great Ville, that's gangster
He missed meals to make mills, that's gangster
Then came back and gave back, that's gangster
Same chick from way back, he's gangster

Reach for my dog 'fore his shit get dicey
Shinin' now, you never seen a clique get icy
Watchin' my step, tryna look just like me
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try, but this shit get pricey
Nigga, you can try
The trials and tribulations of creation
It's a quiet theme of those in dire need of elevation
One minute, infatuation
Next minute, hatin' every statement you makin'
Constant contemplation
Yearnin' for hooks uncanny, search every nook and cranny for inspiration
Step outside for better ventilation
Smoke somethin', hope somethin' comes from the stimulation
Through it all, stay patient
Get in tune with God
For when lightnin' strikes, it's He who decides
We from a crueler side where the youth get euthanized
Small fries get suicide for movin' pies
All while blind eyes get turned from suit and ties
The truth, it lies somewhere in the middle
Of half-ass rappers and cap-ass crackers on Capital Hill
Ain't no protection for hearts that get spilled
When sharin' with this world with art can get killed
Use your discretion
To believe or not to believe? That is the question
