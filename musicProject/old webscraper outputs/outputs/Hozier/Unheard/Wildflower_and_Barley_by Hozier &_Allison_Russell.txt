Springtime in the country
Each time I'm shocked by the light
The world lyin' fallow and you are apart from me
Everythin' in my vision is movement and life
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower and barley
Springtime in the country
I can smell summer on its breath
Low and harrowed lie the fields and the heart of me
Everythin' in my vision, departure, and death
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower, and barley

(The healers) This year, I swear it will be buried in actions (Are healin')
This year, I swear it will be buried in words (The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
I feel as useful as dirt, put my body to work
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)

Springtime in the city
The canal banks are empty again
The grass cryin' out to be heated by bodies
The streets for the laughter of young women and men
Canal boat and trolley, wildflower and barley
You might also like
(The healers) This year, I swear it will be buried in actions (Are healin')
This year, I swear it will be buried in words (The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
I feel as useful as dirt, unreal unearth
(The healers) This year, I swear it will be buried in actions (Are healin')
This year, I swear it will be buried in words (The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
I feel as useful as dirt, put my body to work
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)
Mm (Oh-oh-oh)

Springtime from my window
Another month has not much longer now
The sun hesitates more on each evening's darkenin'
Would all things God allows remain above ground
Like grief and sweet memory, wildflower and barleyEmbed
