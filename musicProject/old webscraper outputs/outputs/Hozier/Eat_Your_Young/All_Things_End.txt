A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a twenty-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right
The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but, love, we did our best"
And we will again

Movin' on in time and takin' more from
Everything that ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
And slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans when wе begin again

We begin again, mm

I havе never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watched my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by bein' somebody's fault
But we've gone long enough to know this isn't what we want
And that isn't always bad

When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends

And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
Or slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Should not change our plans

When we begin again
We begin again
We begin again, mm, darlin'

And all things end
All that we intend is built on sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowin' that everything will end
Won't change our plans when we begin again

And all things end (Knowin' we can always start again)
All that we intend (Knowin' we have another day)
Is scrawled in sand (Knowin' we can always start again)
Or slips right through our hands (Knowin' we have another day)
And just knowing (Knowing we can always start again)
That everything will end
Should not change our plans
When we begin again3Embed
