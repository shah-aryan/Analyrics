12 ContributorsMy Love Will Never Die Lyrics
You've done me wrong
For a long, long time
But after all you've done
I never changed my mind

Honey, please, try to love me
Honey, please, honey, try
My love will never die

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Flowers, flowers grow
Where I'm laid to rest
Honey, pick a blossom
And hold it, hold it to your breast

Honey, you know that's my love
Burstin' loud from inside
My love, oh, my love
My love will never dieSee Hozier LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like9Embed
