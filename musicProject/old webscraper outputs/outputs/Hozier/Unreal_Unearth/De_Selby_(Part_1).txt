At last, when all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God, at the start, couldn't bear

And sit unseen with only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowin' yourself
With all mirrorin' gone from the world

But, still, the mind, rejectin' this new empty space
Fills it with somethin' or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Trína chéile
Le chéile, claochlaithe
Bhfuilis soranna sorcha
Ach tagais 'nós na hoíche
Is claochlú an ealaín
Is ealaín dubh í
