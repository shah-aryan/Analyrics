What you're given, what you live in
Darlin', it finds a way to live in you
And your heart, love, has such darkness
I feel it in the corners of the room

(If I was any closer) After the gloom
(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me
(If I fade away, let me fade away) I, I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer) If I was any closer
(I could only lose me) I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away) No more than I was or than I

Want to be when you fall on me like night every time
And I want to be so far from sight and mind
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turnin'
I'd movе so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gonе
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the mornin'
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sun
If you want it done

Let all time slow, let all light go
I don't need to know where we begin and end
I'd still know you, not being shown you
I only need the workin' of my hands

(If I was any closer) Do you understand?
(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me
(If I fade away, let me fade away) I, I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer) If I was any closer
(I could only lose me) I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away) No more than I was or than I

Want to be when you fall on me like night
I wanna kill the lights

I wanna run against the world that's turnin'
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the mornin'
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sun
If you want it done
(If I was any closer, I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
(If I was any closer, I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)

I wanna run against the world that's turnin'
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the mornin'
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sun
If you want it done3Embed
