Sometimes, it returns like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world, the streets looking brand new
I will not be great, but I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late, I'm still glad I met you

The memory hurts, but does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket to keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road, its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose, the earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh

Sometimes, there's a thought like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to naught when I look back through it
I remember the view, streetlights in the dark blue
The moment I knew I'd no choice but to love you

The speed that you moved, the screech of the cars
The creature still moving, that slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes, gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light, the earth from a distance

See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines

Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh

Darling, there's a part of me
I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete
The traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror balanced there between those eyes
See how it shines
See how it shines2Embed
