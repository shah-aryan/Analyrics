We all need somebody to talk to sometimes
Tell me your problems

Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch

Two phone Baby Keem, fuck you mean? I am here, ho
Ice cream, booger colored piss, Sub-Zero
No, ho, hookers in my clique, we don't fear ho
Lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit, lit
I got a way, I got a politic, I got a bae
Ain't no apologies when I get paid
A dermatologist, I want the face
Don't talk to me when I stump in this bitch
Ho, ho, pussy watery, I duck the tuna fish, ho, ho, yeah
Uh, these niggas actin' like groupie, huh
Lil' bitch, she wanna get mad 'cause I keep on lookin' all in her booby, huh
I got the furniture options, my U-Haul movin', coochie to coochie, huh
I buy the toe when I shop it, rock band on toosie now it look spooky, huh, huh
Easy there boy, shit get greedy there, boy
I rep pg there, boy, my gang need me there, boy
If my sex tape leak, your bitch on TV there, boy
Watch her please me there, boy (Somebody got on my nerves)
Shit get greedy there, boy (Somebody got on my nerves)
I must admit, I am a mess, I cannot fix it, mh
Lil' baby thick, Margiela sweats, look at my dick print, mh
Fuck all the raps, if you confess, that is a big hit, huh
Fuck all the raps, if you confess, it get addressed, bitch

Have you ever been punched in your motherfuckin' face?
What you say? Oh, you haven't? Alright, wait, bitch

Yeah
I want the fade (I want the fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I need the fade, I need my-
We gotta fade
Give me my fade (Fade)
We gotta fade (Fade)
Give me my fade, I want the fade
I, I need the fade, fade
Run me my fade, fade

I can't please everybody, not even me
I wanna please God, but my issues too deep
Bless up, gotta change my number every week
Enemigo, I got 'em hot, I got 'em greased
Shut the fuck up, can't you see my daughter sleep?
Shut the fuck up

Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Can I vent all of my truth? I got nothin' to lose
I got problems in pools, I can swim in my faith
Cameras movin', whenever I'm movin'
The family suin' whatever I make
Murder his stackin', the president actin'
The government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm brackin'
Look at my reaction, my pupils on skates (Woah, woah)
Everything jaded (Jaded)
Team on "Go", let's get it (Get it)
Green gon' grow like veggie (Veggie)
Casino on my debit (Debit)
Fuck your rhetoric, fuck your leverage
Chain no evidence, pass go, motherfuck Confederate
Flags on the back of the medicine
Distributed and peddled in ghettos and
Fuck your heritage, fuck your brainwash detergent
Internet urgent, time travel in purges, every man and virgin
Fuck chatterin' sermons
Fuck your church propaganda, only God know the answer
We oblige in a copacetic manner
Camouflage like a sheep, so we slide through the cancer
Lies and deceit, vibe like a Phantom
Dodgin' police and paramedic retreats
Wanna fuck y'all up for tellin' me "Your life was the one I want"
Been sellin' me concepts ever since I swung
From out of the pro tongue, dedicated myself for recreation
I rest my case, won
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house
Servin' up a look, dancin' in the drought
"Hello" to the rain man, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the safe house1Embed
