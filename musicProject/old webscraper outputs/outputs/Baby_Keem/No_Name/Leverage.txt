Rolling top down
We don't talk now
Where my clique at?
Where my bitch at?
Ten bands to my mans then we flip that, ayy
Ten models tapping in on the dispatch, ayy
What the get up today? Ayy
You ain't got no leverage, nigga, get out my way, ayy
You ain't got no leverage, nigga, get out my way, ayy
You ain't got no leverage, nigga, get out my way

And my momma told me always keep a strap (Keep a strap)
You could shoot a pussy nigga if they go behind your back (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
Run it up and run it up again, (Ayy), ayy
Always on the move, never catch the same friends, ayy
Get back, get back, I count the racks now
New hoe, new hoe, know how to act now (Act)
I just switch lanes, team on my back now
I just tried to give your hoe back but (Uh)
Get up with me bitch (Get, uh)
Get up with me, I'm a dog in my city, bitch (I'm a dog!)
Now I'm getting richer (Get up with me!)
If a nigga want this smoke, put him on a picture, ayy
I just cuff his bitch and knocked her twin sister, ayy
Touchdown in your country on a world tour (World tour)
My ex ain't know shit but acting so sure
She ain't want me then, but she want me now
These hoes wanna hear me for my money now
You might also like
Running top down
We don't talk now
Where my clique at?
Where my bitch at?
Ten bands to my mans then we flip that, ayy
Ten models tapping in on the dispatch, ayy
What the get up today, ayy
You ain't got no leverage, nigga, get out my way, ayy
You ain't got no leverage, nigga, get out my way, ayy
You ain't got no leverage, nigga, get out my way

You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, ayy
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my way, ayy
You ain't got no leverage nigga get out my wayEmbed
