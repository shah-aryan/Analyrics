Just went half on a bitch, bitch wanna see how much I spent (Yeah!)
All eyes on my clip like this, wish yo' ass could get like this, woah (Yeah!)
Off-White be my fit
Made enough cash, gotta bend ten fat
Lil' bitch broke my heart last year
God on the phone, I'll get her like that (Woah, woah!)
Just went half on a bitch, bitch wanna see how much I spent (Yeaah)
All eyes on my clip like this, wish yo' ass could get like this, woah (Yeah!)
Off-White be my fit
Made enough cash, gotta bend ten fat
Lil' bitch broke my heart last year
God on the phone, I'll get her like that (Woah, woah!)

Just got word of the throne
Back up, ho, back, back, back off me
Humbled another bad bitch, I'm sorry
Y'all better know the status, I'm sorry
Dodging another addict
Models in the attic, gettin' antic
My lifestyle jagged, high fashion
I don't talk much, quiet assassin (Yeah, yeah)
It take a lot to get like this, why your man can't get like this? (Woah)
Misha all up in my fit (Woah)
 go to on my whip (Woah)
See you then I swerve (Swerve)
Bitch, I go to work (Work)
See you then I swerve (Swerve)
Bitch, I go to work (Work)
