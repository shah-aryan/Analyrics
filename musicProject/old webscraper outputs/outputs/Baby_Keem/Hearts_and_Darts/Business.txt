My bitch with the extras, ayy
My bitch she know that she—
My bitch, she know that she extra, ayy
My bitch out here taking care of business, ayy
My ho out here taking care of business, ayy, woah
My bitch with the extras, ayy
My bitch she know that she—
My bitch, she know that she extra, ayy
My bitch out here taking care of business, ayy
My ho out here taking care of business, ayy, woah

She want a bag, she don't know fast, she wanna go dumb, dumb, dumb
She bougie facts, she wanna act, I lookin' at (one, one, one, one)
Fuck nigga, try my bitch and you are done, donе, done
Swerving on a lil' bitch, i hit and run, run, run
My bitch fancy, I won't fuck on anyone
Girl don't offеnd me, girl that make that booty fat
The same angles, let me go and dress you down to the ankles (Fuck her now)
(dress you down to the ankles)

My bitch with the extras, ayy
My bitch she know that she—
My bitch, she know that she extra, ayy
My bitch out here taking care of business, ayy
My ho out here taking care of business, ayy, woah
My bitch with the extras, ayy
My bitch, she know that she—
My bitch, she know that she extra, ayy
My bitch out here taking care of business, ayy
My ho out here taking care of business, ayy, woah
