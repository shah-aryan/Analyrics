I see you starin', take a flick
Drop-top McLaren, take a flick
Wonder what I'm wearin', take a flick
Ah, man damn, wonder what I'm wearin', peep the fit
I see you starin', take a flick
Drop-top McLaren, take a flick
Wonder what I'm wearin', take a flick
Ah, man damn, wonder what I'm wearin', peep the fit (Ayy, look, ayy)

Drop that new October, now I'm in the game (In the game)
I realize what it feel like with an ounce of fame (Ounce of fame)
Walkin' through the city, bitches know my name (Know my name)
But I don't know no one, but I know the game (Game)
They don't really love me, they just want the chain (Want the chain)
They don't really want me, they just wanna claim (Wanna claim)
I don't really want the females with a simple brain (Simple brain)
I want a baddie with some details that I can't explain

I see you starin', take a flick
Drop-top McLaren, take a flick
Wonder what I'm wearin', take a flick
Ah, man damn, wonder what I'm wearin', peep the fit
I see you starin', take a flick
Drop-top McLaren, take a flick
Wonder what I'm wearin', take a flick
Ah, man damn, wonder what I'm wearin', peep the fit
You might also like
Ridin' 'round the city for the fun (For the fun, ayy)
Rollin' with my niggas with the funds (With the funds, ayy)
'Member I would beg 'em for the sounds (For the sounds, ayy)
Got these niggas really beggin' for me now (For me now)
Clothes beat up, lookin' bummy now (Bummy now)
Knew some bitches, they ain't wanna fuck me now (Fuck me now)
Now all the bitches claim they love me now (Love me now)
Young in the city 'bout to hit the ground, ayy

I see you starin', take a flick
Drop-top McLaren, take a flick
Wonder what I'm wearin', take a flick
Ah, man damn, wonder what I'm wearin', peep the fit
I see you starin', take a flick
Drop-top McLaren, take a flick
Wonder what I'm wearin', take a flick
Ah, man damn, wonder what I'm wearin', peep the fit, ayyEmbed
