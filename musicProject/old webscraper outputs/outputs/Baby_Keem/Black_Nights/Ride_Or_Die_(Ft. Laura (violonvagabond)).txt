4 ContributorsRide Or Die Lyrics
Heard you had another at the same damn time
Where did it all go wrong?
Took a step for you, don't know why I tried
How was I so dumb?

Hope you find another thats gon' ride or die
Hope you find another that'll ride, ride, ride
Hope you find another thats gon' ride or die
Hope you find another that'll ride (Ayy), ride, ride

See, baby
No sleeping weeks, baby
I call , baby, I do not wanna see, baby
And you ain't tought of me, baby?
You made me fall in love
Pop that xanny in the gutter, I repeat
The sound of us is obsolete
That feeling when I get it, I'ma million bucks
That green,  spinach, never  to give it up
Pressure in my pockets and they mad
And never gave a fuck
Wish I realy realized what I had before I gave it up
You might also like
Heard you had another at the same damn time
Where did it all go wrong?
Took a step for you, don't know why I tried
How was I so dumb?

Hope you find another thats gon' ride or die
Hope you find another that'll ride, ride, ride
Hope you find another thats gon' ride or die
Hope you find another that'll ride, ride, ride

I just wanna see you with a smile in the meantime
I see you running 'round with them jeans on you, oh my

Ayy, baby come back please
Ayy, I won't fuck it up
I had to put them hoes on freeze
No, never gaved no fucks
Know they really want my bucks
You never gave a fuck
You had my back when nobody else would ever bring it up
I said I hate you when I really want you, I'm just being 
Just let me take you, let me renovate you, let me make it up
Heard you had another at the same damn time
Where did it all go wrong?
Took a step for you, don't know why I tried
How was I so dumb?

Hope you find another thats gon' ride or die (Die)
Hope you find another that'll ride, ride, ride (Ride)
Hope you find another thats gon' ride or die
Hope you find another that'll ride, ride, rideEmbed
