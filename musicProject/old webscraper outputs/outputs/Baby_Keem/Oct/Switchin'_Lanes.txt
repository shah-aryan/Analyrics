At the hotel sleep, I ain't gonna get up
She's so high when she want to, woah
I'ma do whatever I want to, woah
I'ma do me if I want to

Bands in my hands all the same
Young, free, balling, switchin' lanes
When I'm gonna get back up
Get it on my own, I don't need backup
Bands in my hands all the same
Young, free, balling, switchin' lanes
When I'm gonna get back up
Get it on my own, I don't need backup

Clown niggas made me from bigger
Fall in love, never with females
I been surrounded by females
Coolin' around with the details
I have fun my  and 
I don't need you in my email
Boss up on these lil niggas
Bloss up on these lil niggas
I feel like they want me dead
Will not see me ahead
Balmain jeans all over my bed
I just wan't her in my bed

At the hotel sleep, I ain't gonna get up
She's so high when she want to, woah
I'ma do whatever I want to, woah
I'ma do me if I want to

Bands in my hands all the same
Young, free, balling, switchin' lanes
When I'm gonna get back up
Get it on my own, I don't need backup
Bands in my hands all the same
Young, free, balling, switchin' lanes
When I'm gonna get back up
Get it on my own, I don't need backupEmbed
