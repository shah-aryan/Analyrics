8 ContributorsRide For Me. Lyrics
Aye, ride for me
You gon' die for me
You gon' be the one to throw that to the side for me
You gon' get a little thicky in the thighs on me
Will you ride for me?
Ride or die for me? Aye
Don't believe this bitches, cause they lie on me
Baby don't you entertain these other guys around me, aye
Ride for me
Baby, ride for me, aye
Ride for me
Ride or die for me

Heart is on stand by
Niggas ain't sayin' none
I can't trust a damn lie
Bitches always sayin' some
I can't catch a damn vibe
Our shooters on stand by
What the fuck you sayin' hoe?
I'mma chill and you can sit back and count these bands though
Park the whip, stop askin' for these keys to the Lambo
I don't understand why you keep actin' like a fan girl
Heard you felt a certain way
On my way
You might also like
Aye, ride for me
You gon' die for me
You gon' be the one to throw that to the side for me
You gon' get a little thicky in the thighs on me
Will you ride for me?
Ride or die for me? Aye
Don't believe this bitches, cause they lie on me
Baby don't you entertain these other guys around me, aye
Ride for me
Baby, ride for me, aye
Ride for me
Ride or die for meEmbed
