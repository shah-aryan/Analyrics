I can't even swerve
Got a 
I can never ever fall in love with a bird

Then I want her
I can never ever make my mind, I'm unsure

I'm unsure, unsure
Unsure, unsure

Unsure, unsure, yeah, I'm unsure

I can't even swerve
Got a 
I can never ever fall in love with a bird
I want her
Then I want her
I can never еver make my mind, I'm unsure

Girl, you know you need to gеt a grip
You been lurking, lurking, all you do is trip
I got bitches on the road highway
They gon' come and do when I say "okay"
Yeah, I want something fair
Don't know why you kicking, you ain't got nothing to fear
I'mma be there, working at the top, aye
Billboard  top 100 wanna tell me that I'm hot, aye
You might also like
I can't even swerve, it's unfair
I can never ever made my mind up for sure
Know you love , I can not work
I can never ever fall in love with a bird

I'm unsure
I'm unsure, unsure
Yeah I'm unsure
I'm unsure, unsure, yeah i'm unsure

She been acting like a bird, uh, I knew that, uh
I've been set, give it back, uh, don't want that, aye
They gon' hate you anyway, yeah, you a snack, yeah
They gon' hate you anyway, you won't let them smack, aye
Watch her throw it back, attack it, want me take them jeans off
Now she said she had a hubby, got her taking rings off
I heard niggas talking rowdy, had to pause in this bih
Heard they wanna take me down so I'mma fall in this bih, word

I can't even swerve
Got a 
I can never ever fall in love with a bird
Know you love , I can not work
I can never ever fall in love with a bird
I'm unsureEmbed
