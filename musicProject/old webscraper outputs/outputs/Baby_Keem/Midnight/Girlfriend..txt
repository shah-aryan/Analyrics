8 ContributorsGirlfriend. Lyrics
Heart is cold, ballin' on Villanova
Shit is getting old, I get revenge, it's over
Get a revenge is old, don't you pretend it's over
Get a revenge is old, don't you pretend it's over

My life feel like, "Oh, shit"
When I get my doses
Get my doses
Them my, Them my doses
That girl not my girlfriend
When I get my doses
Get my doses
Get my, Them my doses, aye

I don't need her, lie to her, deceive her
Close that door, just so I can cheat in peace, uh
Side bitch on the phone while I'm fucking on your niece, eh
I don't need no girlfriend, I don't need no girlfriend
Know she want me for the fame, see me doing well
You gon' have to lose the phone, you gon' kiss and tell
I don't want no ride ride, no lil' bus, I ball like NFL
She gon' lose my pieces, bitch this whip, you know it drive itself
You might also like
My life feel like, "Oh, shit"
When I get my doses
Get my doses
Them my, Them my doses
That girl not my girlfriend
When I get my doses
Get my doses
Get my, Them my doses, aye

Heart is cold, ballin' on Villanova
Shit is getting old, I get revenge, it's over
Get a revenge is old, don't you pretend it's over
Get a revenge is old, don't you pretend it's overEmbed
