I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much
Till I'm broken down and all alone (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?

I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now?
And don't patronize me with lies
I'm a man, be a woman now (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back
But how?
But how?
But how?
But how?
Oh, yeah

Why must we be so ugly?
And please do not think ill of me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to cry
Why?
Why?
Why?
(And how? How?)

But I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying2Embed
