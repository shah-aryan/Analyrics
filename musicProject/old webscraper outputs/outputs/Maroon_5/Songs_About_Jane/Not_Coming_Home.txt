13 ContributorsNot Coming Home Lyrics
When you refuse me, you confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't wanna say
But have to say them anyway
Oh, I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

Oh, yeah

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? (Find yourself alone)
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? Yeah
Does it make you mad
To see how I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, yeah)
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, oh)
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Thank you!
Goodnight!
