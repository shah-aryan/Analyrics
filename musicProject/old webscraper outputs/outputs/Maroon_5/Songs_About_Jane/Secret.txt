Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes, off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation, hit the road

Car overheats, jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long, your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh, no

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no, they can't

I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around, there you are

Cool these engines, calm these jets
I ask you, "How hot can it get?"
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, "I'm not there yet"

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no, they can't

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah6Embed
