Mmm

I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here (Face around here)
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh

You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get
See Maroon 5 LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like
So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah


You better turn your head and run
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear
There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Yeah, tangled
(And I've done you so wrong)
(Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself)
(I don't know how I got so tangled up)1Embed
