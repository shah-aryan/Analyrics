20 ContributorsEcho Lyrics
You lit the neon inside of my chest
There was no vacancy
I felt the flick of the light that she left
You left a space in me

Novocaine
I thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)

I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be

You flipped the beat 'round inside of my chest
Changin' the frequency
You had me trippin' the night that you left
Lost electricity
See Maroon 5 LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like
Novocaine
Thought I couldn't feel no pain
But it still feels like, ooh, when I hear your name
I can't escape, tryin' but I can't escape
(Let me go)

I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be

Yeah, I got this heart-shaped hole inside of me
I try to fill with anything
Like taking trips and buying things
Burn bridges that once guided me
And I hate the way I watched you leave
My ego got the best of me
I gave you insecurities, these tears fall on my Bentley seats
And now all I feel is depressed, all that I taste is regret
I cannot tell what is real, only the pain that I feel
You give me nothing but stress and this echo (Echo, echo, echo)
You left in my chest
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, be
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, be, be (Be, be, be, be)
I got this echo (Echo, echo, echo, echo, echo, echo)
Where my heart used to be, heart used to be, beEmbed
