I'm hurtin', baby, I'm broken down
I need your lovin', lovin', I need it now
When I'm without you, I'm somethin' weak
You got me beggin', beggin', I'm on my knees

I don't wanna be needin' your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killin' me when you're away
Ooh, baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are
I just wanna be there where you are
And I gotta get one little taste

Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?
I'm right here, 'cause I need
Little love, a little sympathy
Yeah, you show me good lovin', make it alright
Need a little sweetness in my life
Your sugar, yes, please
Won't you come and put it down on me?

Babe, my broken pieces, you pick them up
Don't leave me hangin', hangin', come give me some
When I'm without you, I'm so insecure
You are the one thing, one thing I'm livin' for

I don't wanna be needin' your love
I just wanna be deep in your love
And it's killin' me when you're away
Ooh, baby
'Cause I really don't care where you are

And I gotta get one little taste

Sugar, yes, please

Yeah
I want that red velvet, I want that sugar sweet
Don't let nobody touch it unless that somebody's me
I gotta be a man, there ain't no other way
'Cause, girl, you're hotter than a Southern California day
And I wanna play no games, you don't gotta be afraid
Don't give me all that shy shit
No makeup on, that's my sugar
