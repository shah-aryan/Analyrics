How come a nigga ain't enter his prime?
Still gettin' better after all this time
These niggas say that they killers, they lyin'
Only thing I see 'em killin' is time

One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind

Never peddled rock, never said a lot, only what need to be said
Got a little guap, when you get a lot, won't no bitch leave you on read
Don't push me, nigga, my feet on thе ledge
This game is likе follow the leader, if you looking closely enough, then you'll see that I led
The moves that I made, the people I fed, the evil I ducked
They minds is too feeble, they lean on they crutch
I'm bleeding from fighting my demons head up
When I get defeated, believe I get up
I come from a city most niggas ain't heard of until they popped in my first CD, now look
I'm on that Mount Rushmore, you niggas can't front no more, bitch, I'ma reign until FEMA show up
When shots got to ringing, like freedom, I ducked
E&J fell out my cup
Them bullets fly by, that shit sober you up
I'm proud of my niggas, they never switched up
Don't care if it's Michael B. Jordan that's calling my woman to fuck, she ain't gon' never pick up
Sadly, I can't say the same for you niggas
A couple of dollars be changing you niggas
I pray for you niggas, but
You might also like
How come a nigga ain't enter his prime?
Still gettin' better after all this time
These niggas say that they killers, they lyin'
Only thing I see them killing is time

One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the, uh

It's not 'bout the money, it's more about time
Shit makes sense when you see how I spend mine
Burst through the ceiling, I'm feeling sublime
Can't leave the game yet, I feel like LeBron

One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the, uh

How come a nigga ain't enter his prime?
Still gettin' better after all this time
These niggas say that they killers, they lyin'
Only thing I see 'em killin' is time
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind
One hundred mil' and I'm still on the grind

Ooh, one hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still
One hundred mil' and I'm still100Embed
