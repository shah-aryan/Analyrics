68 Contributors3001 Lyrics
What I need with ten cars? I can't drive but one
This for my niggas listening in 3001
As I'm writin' through this song, this world's gone insane
I know you feel me 'cause I bet that shit still ain't changed
I'm on a mission for this chicken, I'ma kill everything
I'm stackin' for a rainy day and it still ain't rained
Why niggas never open up? The answer had me chokin' up
It ain't enough words around to reveal they pain

I'm holdin' on tight to what it feel like to live a peaceful life
Since ridin' a bike, all that I ever knew was beef and strife
Goin' to sleep at night, prayin' that God release the stress
Now I'm on G4 jets across the sеas to decompress
My recеnt checks, how much you think? Hm, decent guess
They growin' more eager, "Cole, who you gon' kill on a feature next?"
Who would you suggest? My nigga just told me the streets a myth
And he's perplexed, they tellin' on people like the teacher's pet
He took a pull of his weed, he high as the trees where eagles nest
I started chiefin' less and less, it had my cerebral vexed
Too many blessings to be depressed
Went from too stressed to being blessed
Now, my new recipe's just keep that fuck shit from my desk
I don't want shit but my breath, I don't want shit but my fam'
Thought I used superglue, nigga, how this gun stick to my hand
I don't even tote no pistol, but that shit sounded so hard
Plus, I don't give a fuck about lyin' once I learned these niggas fraud
I'm finna burn these niggas, dawg
Bring me that urn, these nigga char
Cole, I'ma send 'em to crossroads with the lost souls
I saw Nia Long quote
I would've poked, back when my heart cold
Give her three or four strokes
Then I'm onto the next, shit like a par four
I'm a raw-ass nigga, 6'4", tall-ass nigga
With a sick flow, y'all ask Jigga
How much did the kid gross for that label
Paid dues, had to pay dude for my masters, but I'm grateful
Shit, business is business
I'm in the Ville, the windows is tinted
Keeping my dick in my britches, y'all get to the bitches
Me, I'ma get to this money and split with the missus
Nigga, this vicious, and I'm the truth
All of these niggas fictitious
Look at Jermaine, still runnin' the game
Damn, this physical fitness
Fuck with me, man

I'm on a mission for this chicken, I'ma kill everything
I'm stackin' for a rainy day and it still ain't rained
Why niggas never open up? The answer had me chokin' up
