Stay
Yeah
Hey
Groovy
Yeah
Yeah, hey
Stay

You can drop a "Wet Floor" sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I'm tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I skate town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name right, catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them muh'fuckers hunt me
Come catch me if you want me, know they'll lock me if I stay (Stay)
But where I'ma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son, too
And all we went through, we ain't see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay? (Stay)
Like the hoes when they lay with me
Puppy eyes when I go sayin', "Stay with me"
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and, yeah, I'd love to
But see, I got a girl I'm really makin' love to
Therefore I'm feelin' a lot more guilty when I rub you
That's why I skip all of that kissin' when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can't have me, I never stay
You might also like
Stay
Yeah
Yeah, that's the one
(Stay)
Yeah
Stay

Ha! Life in a hometown
'Fore I could take a step, I'm gettin' grown now
And startin' to notice that I see the same hoes 'round
Guess they had to go 'round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain't got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I'm cookin' up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I'ma get to where I'm goin', then I can't stay (Stay)
Although I love it here
I'll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin' dreams, hopin' somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin' is to know my mother here
Oh, but I'm comin' back, oh boy, believe that
To show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggyback
Hello, my name is Cole and I'm here to stay
Stay
Hey
(Stay)
