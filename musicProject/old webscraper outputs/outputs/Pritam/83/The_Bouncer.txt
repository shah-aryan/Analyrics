8 ContributorsI Remember LyricsIntro (Eighty):
(I remember) I remember
(I remember when) I remember
(We had fun together)
Back in the day

Eighty:
My first time online: 1995
My neighbor's new computer, we took it for a ride
Addicted from the start and it wasn't ending soon
In jpeg rooms seeing women in the nude
But that's not my interest, time I could invest
Deltrees and trojans - computers I could infect
(hold on, I'm getting ahead of myself) take a step back
Started making fan sites of artists that could rap
Pasted some code in an im to start up
Aol choked, it was frozen on the markup
Came across proggies and tools made by others
Kicking people offline, the scene called them punters
You might also likeHad the best strings that would crash and hold the throne
So I couldn't give them out, had to code it on my own
Vb3 download and feeling out of place
Started out clueless, a genozide bas
Sprinting for the lead, I couldn't stay behind
Met CaFFeiNe learned the windows api
Writing bigger apps growing day by day with it
Subclass, trespass, evade rate limits
I'm a warez group mercenary, coding was my pitch
Servers, mass mailers, anything for phish
Tosers, scrollers, ascii art, journals
For masters and subs, overheads, internals
Multithreaded brute force SecurID tokens
German, canadian, it's code that was spoken
A pinpoint in time, most will never know
I coded with the very best from all around the globe
Bounced from private rooms, finding all the spots
Bypassing blocks hide from CATWatch and TOS
Wondered if accounts would even live until the morning
Cause all of this could terminate with on screen warnings
Hook(Eighty):
(I remember) I remember
Remember that? (I remember when)
A different place and time (Back in the day)
(I remember) I remember
Remember that? (We had fun together)
I remember
No sleep feeling fine
Homies crazy
Capturing dreams
(I remember) I remember
Remember that? (Back in the day)
All day all night always online...
Remember that
YTCracker:
This, digital gangster, he made a splash
In a couple private rooms in '98 if my math
Is correct and got immediate respect in my past
With the phreakin', and the hackin', and the spammin' for cash
Just ask astro, I was the fidel castro
Dictator yeah'in while I'm scrolling a macro
Page on 80p
Free hosts for all the hackers and the ao-g's
This, digital gangster, he made a splash
Page on the internet in any subclass
No sendkeys, so the proggies are fast
All the tosers, and the mailers, and the phishes were mass
This, digital gangster, he made a splash
Intro art to his proggies and past
Concert, to the kiddies and dash
Then I spit some raps about it and I'm famous for that
Eighty:
Now, let's continue that the intro's begun
Did I mention? I was running windows 3.1
My 486dx was so potent
Coupled with a 2400 baud modem
Back to the task, this culture this class
These hackers, these teenagers growing up fast
With password stealers reversing was the issue
Switch out the email, flip, and redistribute
I had LeGiON, HaVoK, rolling with a force
Decompiled Fate and I marveled at the source
Coldice, dive, int, and all the vb's
There was server with an 's', and cerver with a 'c'
I was phishing with aim, switching up the game
An app that would interface with aol and aim
Clearing out the rooms eating customers alive
These chat sound strings had me spinning up your drives
For 5-minute code with the con\con stunts
One night run, over 20,000 punts
Spam became my thing, growing interest in my funds
Checks from aff - keep 'em coming every month
Regrets never once, always used caution
Aol was all I had, there was no other option
Vb3 got a bit stale and so we left
Threw away my vbx, made an ocx
My bas 32-bit, the code was a rarity
Custom controls, added gui transparency
Thinking of protocols and keywords we broke
We had fdo scripts and MasterAOL invokes
Getting out the scene, mailing, and serving
Getting into other things like Rainman and Merlin
Insideaol and then observers crew
Lcases, certs, I remember all of you
