Uh

When the people don't have land, they settle for brands
They want Jesus polo sport and Obama again
My foresight is incredible
She pull the foreskin back-back like it's edible
Democracy is just a simulation, the government
I just served over a billion, I'm lovin' it
She got lightskin nipples, yeah, that's my favorite
Shawn White lookin' like he working for the agents
Wish a white dude would tell me 'bout black lives
Wasn't my choice when my parents got me baptized
Black oppression is a business
I see they want to test me like the Litmus
While Noah be fixin' the EQ
I'm just waiting on the day I finally get Me-Too'd
'Cause nigga did a lot of shit, uh
They say I don't belong in politics, uh (Look)

Came in this bitch just to rip heads off, ayy
Check on your head, now you getting checked off (Bling)
Jump in the red Porsche (Skrrt), sped off (Hey)
Put the poodle to your noodle, now you drippin' red sauce (Bah)
I don't listen to your rap, got too many lies in it (Facts)
Don't you come to my hood, you wouldn't survive in it (No)
They don't fuck with me 'cause they can't fuck with me, I get it
Would say your girl pussy wet, but that'd be dry snitchin' (Hey)
This time last year I was dead broke (I was dead broke)
I was one day away from tryna sell coke (Sell coke)
Prolly woulda messed it up, been dead or in jail (Jail)
I was finna sell yay', then Ye hit me on the cell
Like, "Damn, you the truth dawg, alley-oop dawg"
We could run this whole shit, like Dre and Snoop Dogg, ayy
Ayy, cash out
You know the hoes love to see you bring that
You know the road when a nigga been there
You know they all love a nigga when ya
Rollin' in my hoopty, it get me from A to B
I'm good in my hood, them niggas don't play with me
This is Pardi, Flacko, 'Ye, them niggas they came to see
We the ones who set the trends, what they gon' say to me? (Hey)
What they gon' say to me?
We the ones who set the trends, man, that's just the way it be
Ayy, ayy, pay it tall, pay it free (Ayy, ayy)
In this bitch, a pregnancy (Ayy, ayy)
Fuck a lame, legacy (Ayy, ayy)

I'm dead nice, should be paid off of net price alone
Visit financing, get my debts right (Debts right)
Visit your mama after, 'cause the head right
I spread the best advice, invest type (Word)
Woulda got Kanye West outta debt twice (Nah)
'Cause I'm just tryna be the greatest genius since Yeezus
But terms of condition will go over heads like the set price (Huh?)
Hoes like the set price (Think about that)
Comparisons to fake me's, embarrassing (Bitch ass)
If it matters, I'm embarrassing
I think about the state of mind, think about my mind state, it's passive (Passive)
A few millis spent on bad habits, the other half on taxes
And that goes to anybody with money in that bracket (What?)
Think about the state of rapping, the freshmen's in all the classes
All the super seniors mumblin' rappin'
Mumblin' and ramblin'
I can't find it hard to-
I find it hard to find actual talent (Huh?)
I find it challenging to find an actual challenge (Huh?)
Fuck you6Embed
