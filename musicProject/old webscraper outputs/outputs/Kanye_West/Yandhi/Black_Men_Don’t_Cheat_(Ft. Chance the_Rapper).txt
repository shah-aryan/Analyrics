Yo pierre, you wanna come out here?

Black men don't cheat, don't lie
You know why
Cause it's deceit, so why?
I can't never ever tell my bitch , don't try
She trust me, ask why
I don't lie
Black men don't cheat, don't lie
Not to my wife, not to my girl, not to my side
Don't lie
Black men don't , don't try
Cause that shit is for the , ask my
Side chick, she'll tell you that I'm always at the crib
Don't- don't try
Lyrics From The Snippet Of Kanye's Verse:

Where I'm from, I know people just do (Do it)
We don't try (Hol' up)
We don't even stop speak, no lies (Hey)
We coupe, on the troop, my eyes (My eye, my eyes)
The truth is not in the words, it's in my eyes (Woo)
The truth is not in the words, it's in my eyes
The truth is not in the words (Hey)
The truth...

His girl, don't try to call my girl
Tryna tell stories about me
Please don't listen to that bitch
That bitch a fucking lie, why?
Cause she not a black man

I do charity, I'm getting married
Gotta verify, gotta 
And it's very concrete, she don't understand
The  of a fucking brother, man4Embed
