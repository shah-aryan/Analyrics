Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

I chose not to be a slave
Dropped the Wave Runners, now we run the wave
Like we ain't had all the hood rats in Mud Rats
Like you ain't had 'em at good stats and all that
Nobody gon' ruin me
I just called my wife up, let's get Hoover free
I put all my ice up and my Louis V
I just copped my mama crib, I'm back over East
Let me get your ear like Holyfield
From the home of Soldier Field
Coming home, that's how a soldier feels
All that killin' over, that's just overkill
Yeezy back in the Chi', this that Oprah feel

Seasons changing, summer starts to leave
Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring
Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will

Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me
I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave
Open my eyes and see
We will float over water, leaning into shore
As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure
Lift up the child, I know we will24Embed
