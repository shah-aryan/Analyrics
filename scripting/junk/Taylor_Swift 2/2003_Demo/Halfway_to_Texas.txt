When I got mad at you, I always said I'd move to Texas
As a crazy little girl, what was I supposed to do?
And I'm still crazy and I guess I haven't gotten much better
You're getting complicated, so I'll hit the road for someplace new

Well, I'm halfway to Texas, enjoying this roadside view
Just clearing my head, trying not to think back on you
And I'm trying to be strong
Maybe this whole thing is wrong
So I'll focus on the winding road leading to Texas

The wind in my hair is reminding me of the way you held me
Back home is far, I won't give up just yet
Right now you'll probably call wondering what I'm doing
And a voice in the wind will tell you I'm a long time gone

Well, I'm halfway to Texas, kinda thinking back on you
There's a thought in my head saying my best option is you
And I hope I can stay strong
I'm starting to think this is wrong
I'll just focus on the winding road leading to Texas

I've stopped the car, all I can think of is you
Maybe you were right, now I know how much I love you

I'm halfway to Texas, I'm turned around 'cause I love you
I'm coming back to you darling, wanna spend my life with you
And I know I have this wrong
I've stayed away from you this long
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas
I'm taking you with me next time I go to TexasEmbed
