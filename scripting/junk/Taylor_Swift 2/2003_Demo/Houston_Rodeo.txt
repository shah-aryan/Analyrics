Shooting star flew across the sky
A light turned on in the barn
Nine-year-old boy and a stream of joy
Just sitting there trying to keep warm
A soon-to-be-mama quarter horse
Looked up at the sky
Then came a foal and he set a goal
Then tears came to his eyes

Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some just might come true
And if he rides, that young foal's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He’s going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse you ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

Every night, that boy would ride on that horse in moonlight
Black and white, he was a bumpy ride
But that boy was gonna make him right
Through heat and snow, they rode and rode
Soon they were best friends
By light of dawn, they were always gone
Following trails that never end

Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some, they have to come true
If he rides that yearling's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He’s going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

And when he was a teen
Made it to the rodeo
And as the gate released
He took on the Houston rodeo

He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Oh, that boy, he's gonna ride
Houston rodeo, ohEmbed
