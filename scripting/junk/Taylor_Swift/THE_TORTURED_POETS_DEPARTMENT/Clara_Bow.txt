"You look like Clara Bow
In this light, remarkable
All your life, did you know
You'd be picked like a rose?"

"I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened
Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan"

"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling"
"You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips
Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
Half moonshine, a full еclipse"

"I'm not trying to exaggeratе
But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
They all wanna say..."

"This town is fake, but you're the real thing
Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
Take the glory, give everything
Promise to be dazzling
The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
Flesh and blood amongst war machines
You're the new god we're worshipping
Promise to be dazzling"

Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
Demanding more
Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
Do they let you know
It's hell on earth to be heavenly
Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
"You look like Taylor Swift
In this light, we're lovin' it
You've got edge, she never did
The future's bright, dazzling"6Embed
