Ooh
Come vibe with a real nigga (Oh, yeah)
Get high with a real nigga (Oh, yeah)
Come vibe with a real nigga (Yeah, yeah)

Come vibe with a real nigga
Bonnie and Clyde with a real nigga
Get high with a real nigga
Come take a pic with a real nigga
She tryna' fuck on me, tryna' fuck with me
I'm a different cloth baby, they ain't cut like me
I ain't lovin' no hoe, ain't no trust in me
69, got me lickin' while she suck on me, yeah
And on the phone she be all up in her feelings
And deep down, I don't really want no dealings
Kinda hard for me to keep my distance
Cause' she love this dick all in her kidneys

Your vibe is so cursed
All alone, it hurts
With you, I smirk
When we apart, it's a curse
I love your curves
And everything, you worth
We talk, we flirt
And you my baby 'til I'm in the dirt, yeah
See NLE Choppa LiveGet tickets as low as $103You might also like
Our love is poison, but I don't give a fuck
Kisses all down your neck while I fuck you up
Slow strokin', deep all in her guts
Ain't take the condom off, baby girl, get yo nut
She like to smoke and chill, baby keep it real
Are you gonna ride, are you gonna kill
Keep it real, yeah
When I kiss on your neck, girl you love that shit
From the back, pull your hair, yeah you love this dick
Camera out, make a flick, on some movie shit
That pussy wet, yeah, on some Jacuzzi shit
When I call on a late night
You always answer me
In public you so innocent
In private you a freaky dancer

Your vibe is so cursed
All alone, it hurts
With you, I smirk
When we apart, it's a curse
I love your curves
And everything, you worth
We talk, we flirt
And you my baby 'til I'm in the dirt, yeah
Come vibe with a real nigga (Come vibe with a real nigga)
Get high with a real nigga (Get high with a real nigga)
(You my thug baby) Bonnie and Clyde with a real nigga3Embed
