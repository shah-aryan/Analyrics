Hey, yeah
You lucky I ain't sayin' nothin' to ya, ayy
You dummy, I ain't playin', I been too sick
'Cause you only come around when you drunk or you high, ayy, yeah
You only come around when you drunk or you high, hey

Seen the light, what your friend said, huh
What your friend said
Oh, you so classy now, huh
Yeah, you fancy now, uh
But you only come around
When you drunk or you high
I need you to roll the dice
Roll the dice, yeah (Yeah), roll the dice, hey, roll the-
I want her to roll the dice, hey
Roll the dice, hey, roll the dice, yeah, roll the-
I want her to roll the dice, hey
Roll the dice hey, roll the dice, yeah, roll the-
I want her to roll the dice

My new bitch top five
I said my new bitch top five (Top five, top five)
If a nigga touch my hoe then he might have to die
I'ma buss it down when I touch it
But she wanna roll
And my pockets swole
I might make a midnight swerve
And my baby drive it slow
All you see is dough
When you open up the drawer
Living fancy
I got snipers in the city don't you chance it
All my presidents are dead I took some chances
And I been said don't at me, nah (aye)
Sent a couple bands to my moms she don't ask me twice
Now they wanna pull up on a man 'cause I (hey)

Seen the light, what your friend said, huh
What your friend said
Oh, you so classy now, huh
Yeah, you fancy now, uh
But you only come around
When you drunk or you high
I need you to roll the dice
Roll the dice, yeah (Yeah), roll the dice, hey, roll the-
I want her to roll the dice, hey
Roll the dice, hey, roll the dice, yeah, roll the-
I want her to roll the dice, hey
Roll the dice hey, roll the dice, yeah, roll the-
I want her to roll the dice2Embed
