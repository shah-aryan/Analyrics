Track: Get Back In My Life

Lyrics:
9 ContributorsGet Back In My Life Lyrics
You are relentless
I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?
You beat me senseless
I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?

Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Oh, yeah, yeah

You reprimanded
You're so demanding
But I've got time
I don't mind at all (Oh)
You're picture perfect
Completely worth it
You've got my back against the wall (Yeah, yeah)

Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone
And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me 'cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Right on back to you, right on back to you

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone

(Get back in my life) Get back in my life (Ooh)
(What I'm looking for) Come on now (I think you should know)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come knock on my door (Oh)
What I'm looking for
I'll never leave you alone
Get back in my life (Oh)
Come scream and scratch on my door
What I'm looking for
I can't do this anymore
Get back in my life (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come scream and scratch on my door
What I'm looking for
Get back in my life (Get back in my life)
What I'm looking forEmbed
