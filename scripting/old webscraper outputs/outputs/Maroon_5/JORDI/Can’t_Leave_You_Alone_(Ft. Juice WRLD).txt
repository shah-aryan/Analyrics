42 ContributorsCan’t Leave You Alone Lyrics
I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me

Quick, give me some Novocaine
It's almost like you're pulling me closer to tell me it's over
But I like the change
I know you think that love's temporary

But please don't compare me to
Anybody, anybody, anybody else now, yeah
Tell me you ain't fallin', but I see you on the way down, woah

I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
I just can't leave you alone
We keep coming back for more, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
See Maroon 5 LiveGet tickets as low as $47You might also like
So, tell me somethin' about you
Everything you been through
So, what you got to lose?
So, what you got to lose?
It could be about the past
Or something brand new
What do we got to lose?
What do we got to lose?

But please don't compare me to
Anybody, anybody, anybody else now (Else now), oh (Oh)
Tell me you ain't fallin', but I see you on the way down, woah

I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
I just can't leave you alone (Ooh)
We keep coming back for more, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me (Yeah, I told you everything about me)
She throw the pass to the Devil and I intercept, yeah (Ooh-woah)
Have you ever had a make out session with death? Yeah (Oh, yeah)
In a strip club tryna get all the pretty girls to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah, huh
I remember back in high school, they said I wouldn't stand a chance (Chance, chance)

I just can't leave you alone
We keep goin' back and forth, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me
I just can't leave you alone (Oh, oh)
We keep coming back for more, oh
Why can't you just tell me how you're feelin'?
Why can't you admit it?
I told you everything about me

So, tell me somethin' about you
Tell me somethin' about you2Embed
