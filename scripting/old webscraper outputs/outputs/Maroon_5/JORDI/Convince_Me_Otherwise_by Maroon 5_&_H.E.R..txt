It's been a minute, it's been some time now
(It's been a minute) Woah
I wanna tell you, I need you right now (I wanna tell you, ooh)

You can't convince me otherwise (Convince me)
I know I wouldn't be surprised (Surprise me)
If you tried to convince me otherwise, you know I
I can't keep waiting, waiting for you

Oh woah
Waiting for you

Don't get me started, it's not my fault
(I know, I know) Oh, darling
Don't get me started, it's not my fault (Fault)

Or would you convince me otherwise? (Convince me)
Oh, surprise me (Convince me, yeah)
(Now I need you to) Convince me otherwise (Oh)
Don't gеt me started
Can't keep waiting for you

You know I will now (I will, I will)
Baby, now I don't care (I can't bе bothered)
I don't care, I don't care
I can't keep waiting

Don't do this to me (Don't do it to me, yeah)
Yeah, yeah, darling (To me, yeah, yeah)
Ah-ha, don't do this to meEmbed
