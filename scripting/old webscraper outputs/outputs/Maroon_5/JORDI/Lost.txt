Had no connection, no faith or direction, no
Searching and searching for someone to save my soul (Ooh)

Ooh, I was swept up in a wave, swept up in a wave
Ooh, then I heard you say my name
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found
Lost, I was lost, I was lost 'til you loved me
Now I'm found, now I'm found, now I'm found
Yeah, you took me to a place, it was safe, it was sound
Lost, I was lost, now I'm found

I was so broken, my heart was an empty space
Life was a joke 'til the moment I saw your face
Saw your face, saw your face

Ooh, I was swept up in a wavе, swept up in a wave
Ooh, then I hеard you say my name
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
