Lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

Baby, baby, where'd you go?
My starlight, my firefly
I've been searchin' high and low
Like all night, my whole life

For someone like you to really take my breath away
And I can't be lonely, no, you gon' be the death of me

'Cause I'm lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

You got me lovesick
But I love it
Yeah

Lovesick, I'm falling, I can't be trusted
If that's what you want, thеn rush in
Trust me when I say, I want this, want this

For someone like you to really take my breath away
And I can't be lonely, no, you gon' be the death of me, oh

'Cause I'm lovesick, you know I can't fight it anymore (Anymore)
'Cause I love it, the way my heart drops to the floor

You got me lovesick (Lovesick)

You got me lovesick, lovesick (But I love it)
You got me lovesick, lovesick
