Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinkin' 'bout it drivin' on the freeway
Wonderin' if I really tried everything I could
Not knowin' if I should try a little harder

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

I'm kickin' the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kickin' the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad
Sad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sittin' here tryin' not to look back
Still lookin' at the road we never drove on
And wonderin' if the one I chose was the right one

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

I'm kickin' the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kickin' the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
I'm so sad, sad
So sad, so sad

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

I'm kickin' the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kickin' the dirt 'cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have
And I'm kickin' the curb, 'cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
I'm so sad, so sad11Embed
