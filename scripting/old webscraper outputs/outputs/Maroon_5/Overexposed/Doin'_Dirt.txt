Oh!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now, I wanna find you, but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

Hey you, say that you're only havin' fun, and then
You call me up at 3 AM again
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now (Now) all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts (Oh)

Yeah, come on

So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home (Oh)

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
