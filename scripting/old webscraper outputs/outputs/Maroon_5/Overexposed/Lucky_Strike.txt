You're such a motivator, I gotta get you where
So sick of sayin', "Yes sir, yes sir"
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rockin', keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said, "I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize"
She'll make me want her right now, right now

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) My lucky strike
(Whoa) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike
My lucky strike
My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million9Embed
