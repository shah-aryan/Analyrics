Track: Figure It Out

5 ContributorsFigure It Out Lyrics
I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed
Her need; cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games
Why did you run away?

We could spend some time together
What he had, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see your getting it
So let’s figure it out, let's go

I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that you're passionate
I’m happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last?
I know you wanna break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it’s gotta be

We could spend some time together
What he has, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So let’s figure it out, let's go

I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy you’re going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out, let's go
We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's... go1Embed
