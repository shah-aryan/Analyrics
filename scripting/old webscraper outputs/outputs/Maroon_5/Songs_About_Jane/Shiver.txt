You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied til I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in (Hey)
And I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, oh
(You feel your heart begin to race!)

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin
Yeah, yeah, there may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah, yeah)5Embed
