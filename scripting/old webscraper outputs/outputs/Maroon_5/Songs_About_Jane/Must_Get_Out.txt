Track: Must Get Out

14 ContributorsMust Get Out Lyrics
I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
Oh yeah

"This is not goodbye," she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

There's only so much I can do for you, oh
After all of the things you put me through, oh

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
(Whoa) I'm lifting you up (Oh)
I'm letting you down (Whoa)
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around (Whoa)
I'm not giving up (Whoa)
I'm making your love (Yeah)
This city's made us crazy and we must get out4Embed
