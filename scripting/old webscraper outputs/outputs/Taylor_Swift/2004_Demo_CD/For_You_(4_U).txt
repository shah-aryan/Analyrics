It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you

Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you

It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for youEmbed
