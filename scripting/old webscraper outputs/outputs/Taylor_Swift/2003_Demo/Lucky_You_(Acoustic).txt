There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, "Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you"

She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travеls, lives they unravel
Mind ovеr matter, that's what she says

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, "Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you"

Maybe she'll sing you do-do-do-do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey, she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you aren't so far away

Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, "Lucky you, lucky you"Embed
