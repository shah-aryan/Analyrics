40 ContributorsStealth Mode Lyrics
Yeah, uh

We don't do sparklers
We give specific instructions to bring out the bottles in stealth mode
I'm hearing there's rats in the building
They sayin' it's not up to par with the health code
I feel like that's none of my business
Nigga be steadily giving opinions
On shit that don't even concern 'em
I got a lot to get off of my sternum

I been considerin' extending a olive branch
Building bridges with niggas that burned 'em
Like life too short to hold on to things
When Los was calling my line I stared at the screen whenever the phone would ring
Wish I could've said goodbye, even now I might cry while I'm writing this poem to sing
Life is a crazy thing
Look how I got cut from the team, now I own the team
Just a little piece, I ain't tryna make a scene
Like it's something it's not, my whole regime is up in the spot
Carefully watched by dozens of thots
Fuck it, I'll just have a couple of shots
Take off the edge and get out my head
When you up at the top it's a coveted spot
You might also like
We don't do sparklers
We give specific instructions to bring out the bottles in stealth mode
I'm hearing there's rats in the building
They sayin' it's not up to par with the health code
I feel like that's none of my business
Nigga be steadily giving opinions
On shit that don't even concern 'em
I got a lot to get off of my sternum

I got a lot to get off of my sternum
I got a lot to get off of my sternum, yeah
Bas, you should come right here

Niggas love talking a whole lot of bullshit and calling it guidance
I been in my mode, I'm not gonna hold you, I doubled my commas
I cycle through hoes, I gaze on the lotus, get head while I'm drivin'
You blow up a phone, we didn't even notice 'cause we was just vibin'
Niggas love talking a whole lot of bullshit and calling it guidance
I been in my mode, I'm not gonna hold you, I doubled my commas
I cycle through hoes, I gaze on the lotus, get head while I'm drivin'
You blow up a phone, we didn't even notice 'cause we was just vibin'

We was just vibin'
We was just vibin'1Embed
