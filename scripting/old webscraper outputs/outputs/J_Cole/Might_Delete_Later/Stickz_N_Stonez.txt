Are you guys ready to party tonight?
Are you sure?
Yeah
I'm fuckin' with you, right? Okay
Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, can I get a—
Ladies and gentlemen
Hunger
Hunger
Yeah
Uh

They gotta hide they face
They was predictin' a nigga to fail, turns out that was not the case
I'm rockin' a mask with lots of cash, I look like I robbed a bank
Can't even rob the bank that I use, my money is not with Chase
Foreign deposit safes, I'm writin' this shit on a private plane
Somеtimes I be flyin' commercial still
Thеse niggas get rich and become so detached, they music start havin' that surface feel
Not a subliminal, speakin' in general, feelings get hurt when words get spilled
Sticks and stones may break your bones, but sayin' my name in a verse will kill
Word to the wise, nigga, we heard all them lies before
My number ones come from albums, theirs is burgers and fries to go
Go against me, your odds is low
I don't even got no opps for real
Nigga, just give me my props for real
I done did everything, I'm 'bout to chill
Count the mills in cribs on top of hills
Mad chips, cash rich, my stash thick, I'm Dr. Phil
Stash thick, I'm Steve Harvey
Bad bitch, two friends, hat trick, caught three bodies
And tell 'em to go like they E-40, uh
You might also like
Nigga don't want no smoke with me, I'm one of them ones
Tiptoein' through the slums, duckin' a hundred-round drum
I took my lumps way out in Cumberland, niggas ain't hunt where I hunt
Shit, I'm up, stomach still rumblin', niggas ain't done what I done
Nigga don't want no smoke with me, I'm one of them ones
Hop on a song with whoever, I ain't duckin' no one-on-ones
Ayy, pull up the track, I'm 'bout to black, I'm goin' on a whole 'nother run

Yeah
Ladies and gentlemen
Uh

So much drama on the street, feel like the beef is random
Murder galore, turn into Thor, I gotta keep a hammer
Case weather get inclement, shots rain on the innocent, the neighbors still don't know who sent them shits, it's like a secret Santa
Me, I'm out here reachin' for a higher frequency, I plan to
Rest my feet in presidential suites or sleep in beach cabanas
Skeetin' on thousand-count sheets, I'm hittin' freaks in tandems
Bust 'em down, then throw 'em in the cab like they from East Atlanta (Tonight)
How it feel to see the flyest bitch and know that he can land 'em? (Are you sure?)
Every word I speak on beats, it's guaranteed to feed the fandom (I'm fuckin' with you, right? Okay)
Weaklings wanna walk inside my sneakers, watchin' from the bleachers, only time they'll see the roles reversed is if they lease a Phantom (Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, can I get a—)
Bad investment, but what else you had expected?
Moms was broke my whole adolescence, never had a lesson
'Cept for pawn shop hustles to times collections, had her stressin'
Bitches couldn't tell if I was poor or just bad at dressin'
It was a bit of both, when I took it up top, I took an oath, huh
I was gon' hit a lick, break bread with my dogs, and split a loaf, huh
And take over the game, make sure that my name's considered GOAT
Now I'm back home as the best in the world, The Fall Off, come and hear the growth
On God, nigga
Nigga don't want no smoke with me, I'm one of them ones
Tiptoein' through the slums, duckin' a hundred round-drum
I took my lumps way out in Cumberland, niggas ain't hunt where I hunt
Shit, I'm up, stomach still rumblin', niggas ain't done what I done
Nigga don't want no smoke with me, I'm one of them ones
Hop on a song with whoever, I ain't duckin' no one-on-ones
Ayy, pull up the track, I'm 'bout to black, I'm goin' on a whole 'nother run

Ladies and gentlemen
