Hey, Jermaine
I know you're on the road
I know you're on your best rapper alive shit
But I hope you're doing good
And I hope you ain't forget about me
Because I'm thinking about you
And I hope you come to the Ville soon
Alright, hit me up

I love her and I need her
She keeps givin' me fever, fever, yeah
Like blowin' on sativa
She keeps takin' me deeper, deeper, yeah
It's all ups and downs I found
When she comes around, she be givin' mе fever, fevеr, uh
Now go throw the past away
We ain't guaranteed to see a better day, better day, uh

Got a new deal, just ran a train on a label
They not real and so they came with some fables
Without a chain, them boys plain as a bagel
I'm from the Ville, they sellin' 'caine if they able
I play the middle, I never hustled or nothin'
But I got lit, now I got the customers jumpin'
I'm on the road and, yeah, I'm thinkin' about you
Runnin' through hoes and now you think I forgot you
How could I do that? All that vibe you had
All that fight you had on you
I want them but I want you too
How can both those things be true?
You might also like
Ooh, when can I see you? (True)
Ooh, when can I see you?
Ooh, when can I see you?
Ooh, when can I see you? (True)

I love her and I need her
She keeps givin' me fever, fever, yeah
Like blowin' on sativa
She keeps takin' me deeper, deeper, yeah
It's all ups and downs I found
When she comes around, she be givin' me fever, fever, uh
Now go throw the past away
We ain't guaranteed to see a better day, better day, uhEmbed
