One bright mornin' changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathin', you wake
Your eyes open at first, a thousand miles away
But turnin' shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believin' in
Could this be how every day begins?

The sky set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts, you fillin' my cup
The sun comin' up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Bеfore the first light
(Some bright mornin')

Onе bright mornin' goes so easy
Darkness always finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to callin' out your name
But after this, I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again

The sky set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts, you fillin' my cup
The sun comin' up

Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes), yeah
Yeah, like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes), yeah, yeah
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(Some bright mornin' comes)1Embed
