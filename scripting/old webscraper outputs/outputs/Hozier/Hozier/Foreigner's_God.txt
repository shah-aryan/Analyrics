53 ContributorsForeignerâ€™s God Lyrics
She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
Still, my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs

Always a well-dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me

Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

Wonderin' who I copy
Musterin' some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breakin' if I try conveying
The broken love I make to her

All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me

Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief


Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
Screamin' the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief21Embed
