Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me

No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?," no vacant stare
No time for me

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin

To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
That hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming, honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door106Embed
