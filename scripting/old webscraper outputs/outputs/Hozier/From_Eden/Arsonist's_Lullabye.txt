Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

When I was a child, I heard voices
Some would sing and some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child, I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame, something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

When I was sixteen, my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something would always rule me
I knew this scent was mine alone

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
Always keep them on a leash

When I was a man, I thought it ended
When I knew love's perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my wake

All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever tame your demons
But always keep them on a leash39Embed
