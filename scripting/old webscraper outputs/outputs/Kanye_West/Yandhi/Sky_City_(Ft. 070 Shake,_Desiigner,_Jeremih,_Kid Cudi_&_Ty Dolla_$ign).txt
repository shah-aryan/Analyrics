Said it's my year, know it’s my year, my year (Oh)

We just fly, yeah (Woo!), we just fly yeah, fly yeah (Git, git, fly, yeah)
Build a city, in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah (Oh)

Oh, it's always lovely in your company, I'll be
Oh, it’s always lovely in your company, I'll leave you lonely (Your company)
Oh, it's always lovely in your company, I'll be (Oh, no, no)
Oh, it's always lovely in your company (Oh, no, no)

Said it's my year, know it's my year, my year (Oh)
Can we fly, yeah? We can fly, yeah, high, yeah (We can fly)
Build a city in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah
Said it's my year, know it’s my year, my year (Oh)

Out of the body, uh, jewelry is gaudy, um
Serious society, my spirit is Godly
I’m buildin' a buildin’ where children can lobby
So we can make billions from buildin' a hobby
I really fly private just, me and a pilot
I'm runnin' for presi’, um, "deez nuts" on the ballot, yeah
Bein' exotic, my genes is robotic
They bought us like slaves and uh, sold us like product
I bought a factory, pickin' the cotton
Bought a factory, sent 'em to college
He made it already with nothin' to lose
And free attitude with nothin' to prove
We goin' crazy, I got the juice
Playin' them dead to get out the noose
I don't need your point-of-views
I can't hear you at this altitude
And they steady sayin' that I'm brute
I be rude if I don't come beat the shit out you
You might also like
And if we die, yeah, then we die, yeah, ah, yeah
We can fly, yeah, we can fly, yeah, ah, yeah
In the night, yeah, in the night, yeah, ah, yeah
In the night, in the night
Oh, no, it's always lovely in your company
In the night, serenity all in the city (Oh)
Oh, it's always lovely in your company
Leave me alone in the night when I'm all in the city

In the sky, yeah, in the sky, yeah, sky, yeah
We just fly, yeah, we just fly yeah, fly, yeah (Fly, yeah)
Build a city in the sky, yeah, the sky, yeah

Just, we're building in the sky
A world for you and I (Oh)
Let those angels in me fly high (Ayy, oh)
Ooh, we're building in the sky
A brand new world for you and I (Ayy, oh)
Let the angels in me fly high (Oh)
Oh, I hope I never fall weary
Help me levitate my pain (Ooh)
Oh, good heaven, sing to me, to me (Ooh)
Let me outsoar my faith
Let me outlast the shame (Ooh)
At the same time, don't change a thing, a thing
Ooh-ooh-ooh
