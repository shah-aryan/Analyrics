We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all, we at war with ourselves
Now let me hear you say

(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
Because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)

You know what the Midwest is? Young and restless
Where restless (Niggas) might snatch your necklace
And next these (Niggas) might jack your Lexus
Somebody tell these (Niggas) who Kanye West is
I walk through the valley of the Chi where death is
Top floor, the view alone will leave you breathless *gasps*
Try to catch it, *gasps* it's kinda hard
Getting choked by detectives, yeah, now check the method
They askin' us questions, harass and arrest us
Sayin', "We eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast"
Huh? Y'all eat pieces of shit? What's the basis?
We ain't going nowhere but got suits and cases
A trunk full of coke, rental car from Avis
My mama used to say, "Only Jesus can save us"
Well, mama, I know I act a fool
But I'll be gone 'til November, I got packs to move, I hope
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
Because the Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
Pray is that my feet don't fail me now
(Jesus walk)
And I don't think there's nothin' I could do now
To right my wrongs
(Jesus walk with me)
I wanna talk to God
But I'm afraid 'cause we ain't spoke in so long
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
The Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray
Is that my feet don't fail me now
(Break me down, break me down
Break me down, break me down
Break me down, break me down)

To the hustlers, killers
Murderers, drug dealers, even the strippers
(Jesus walks for them)
To the victims of welfare, feel we livin' in Hell here, hell yeah
(Jesus walks for them)
Now, hear he, hear he, want to see Thee more clearly
I know He hear me when my feet get weary
We're the almost nearly extinct
We rappers is role models: we rap, we don't think
I ain't here to argue about His facial features
Or here to convert atheists into believers
I'm just tryna say the way school need teachers
Kathie Lee needed Regis, that's how I need Jesus
So here go my single, dawg, radio needs this
They said you could rap about anything except for Jesus
That means guns, sex, lies, videotape
But if I talk about God my record won't get played?
Well, if this take away from my spins
Which'll probably take away from my ends
I hope it take away from my sins
Bring the day that I dream about
Next time I'm in the club, everybody screamin' out
(Jesus walk)
God show me the way
The Devil's tryna break me down
(Jesus walk with me)
The only thing that I pray
Is that my feet don't fail me nowYou might also likeEmbed
