(Let me know)
Do I still got time to grow?
Things ain't always set in stone
That be known let me know
Let me

Seems like, street lights, glowin'
Happen to be just like moments, passin'
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
All the streets, glowin'
Happen to be just like moments, passin'
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there In the streets

In the streets
Just not there in the streets
I'm just not there
(Shout out to Grey's Anatomy)

Seems like, street lights, glowin'
Happen to be just like moments, passin'
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see (I know my destination)
But I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowin'
Happen to be just like moments, passin'
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there
All the street lights, glowin'
Happen to be just like moments, passin'
In front of me so I hopped in, the cab and
I paid my fare see I know my destination
But I'm just not there In the streetsYou might also likeEmbed
