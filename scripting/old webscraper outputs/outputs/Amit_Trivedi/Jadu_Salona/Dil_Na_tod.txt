42 ContributorsUndaground Choppers 7 Lyrics
Tool in my pocket, I act a fool and for cock a shoot
I'mAnd then rocket shooting 'em, my opposition won’t stand a chance
All I do is rockin' and get the loot and I’m bout to make stupid
A posse of new niggas, stopping with the shenanigans
And clueless in logic, hit the booth with the garbage
They foolish and gotta be smoking for thinking they spit equivalent
Finna shoot up harder than the cannon like the Taliban
Opposition losing from it, you can see the ambulance
Diggin' the grave when I'm bustin' once I getting away
Up in the game and it ain't no way I'mma give it away
It takes a little more to speak to me to spit with the great
Gotta come to wreck and they listen and like a spit in the face
Shout out to kVr and my lil' brother Leech
Burner hit the greenlight so you know we run the streets
Haters turn to apostles and then puzzled when they want the beef
And may be workin' with some talent but they fooling under me
So when you’re rocking it’s summed with illegibility
Hardly working on flow you’re just showing your versatility
Thinking they really be step pin'but lack a proper utility
Necessarilly give up on speaking incredibility
Gotta be on a mission with instrumentals, the killer bee
Me, I'm mighty still so its offin' niggas to killer beats
Rockin' it and droppin' these other niggas thats pushin' hits
Suck and me rely roll out in the cut and then spit it in, now I finna feast
Never big enough, but just capable out the saucer
And the way that I spit the flames just to breaking 'em niggas off with the venom
Making it vivid, this illustration of killing the rhythm
Make no mistake, I be bucking, fuck what you thought of me
And I'm 'bout to pivot, not giving a shit ‘bout the competition I'm starting by stacking bitch I'm clapping I'm on a mission
As soon as I get this shit I'ma stickin 'em in the vault
And then fucking with the machinery, cut from another cough nigga
You rap fast well I rap fast too, now your fast round moves like a lot of fast food
When I'm in a bad mood I'ma chop it cock it back and then I blast too
Man, in other words I'm bad news
If I had to, I could a make pussy nigga disappear
With the steel, sipping genius hoping I forget the fear
With the key, looking like I'm painting a picture crystal clear
With the skill, like it doubles on another hemisphere
I'ma need to get a deal, chances I was changing real, think I’m finna find em, nigga
Talking an anomaly, independent and I'ma be killing shit cause I'm properly one of the illest meaning these other niggas just wanna beef
And everytime I wanna beef, promise I'ma hit, play the instrumental and I bet he fix
Talking I’m a G, don’t compare me to a motherfucker
Saying nothing, giving a fuck about your SPS
You might also like
Better watch what the fuck you sayin'
Put you in the dirt, remind you who the fuck I am
Have no fear for fuckin man I'll put a hole in ya chest and then BUCK BUCK again
Trust me you don't really want to start a rivalry
You're bout to get acquainted with the evil side of me
And every single demon that's living inside of me
You talking all that fake bitch don't lie to me
I smell the pussy in ya pants from a mile away
You're like the bitch that gets kicked out and tries to stays
Mane I gotta teach you a lesson I'm a find a way I swear to God Imma find a way (Imma find a way)
I'll rip ya heart out pull your card out, you was faking from the start out, sub par sound I'm ready to jump out the car fresh from the bar now
With a look of insanity on my face yelling out WHO'S HARD NOW
I spit it too hot flaming blue fire
Tell me what the fuck that you got, frontin you hot my lyrics hit you like a jump shot only a few got
And hit 'em up like 2Pac now who shot ya
Better chill pop a Xanax, or the plan next, has mechanics, of my anger expanding
And will leave you branded as a pansy that is better off dancing than rapping, I'm laughing
(Something is wrong with me)
Grip on the clip in my pocket just make it a watch out you'll be safe
Stacking a stack while I'm grippin' the strap known for slapping em in the face
Sticking the mid finger up with the klique making 'em walk up out the way
Talking the talking and walking the walk are nothing like the same
Thinking of bleeding the blood out the block
Talking ain't shit so I'm taking a shot
Shakin' the pavement the way that its breaking gonna knock 'em out the way
Fuckin' around when I need to be taking my medicine
Telling myself that this is the best that it will ever get
Living in hell could somebody tell me what heaven is
Reppin' kaotic and breaking bread with the bretheren
Sick of the head ache think I'll pop another excederine
Man he's just talking nothing is real like he says it is
Watching 'em faking I'll stick their face to the pavement mane do you wanna be famous 'cause right now you're irrelevant
Motherfuckin' animal no way to word it better whats the problem with the weather its my cold cold flow
No not bonez rap so slow, sps lord let it go
'Cause I could get it choppin' if thats what you really want but I'd rather bring a better rhythm rip it off the top
You can fuckin' skip it but I wish you'd rather not 'cause I promise on or off, this shits still hot
I see you YouTube keyboard warriors your countin' words and every syllable per second that shit's so absurd
So where's the real rap, G-Funk and all that?
Glockapella bring art of war back adrenaline rush 2Pac and ahh man, Dark Man X where the fuckin' hood at?
Who that with a rhythm thats so fly, ohhh that little man bad no lie
Move out! Gonna be dat one die, no lie man me waste no time
Shoot that! Ammo at backbone spine
Prove that! Get it tatted that's for life
We could do that! don't move past that line (Lets get it then)
Spittin' within rhythm a hater be checkin' me out
Ya better be careful with your kisser get a dick in ya mouth
I got the paparazzi poppin' pictures murderin' time
Going kamikaze off my rocker rockets align
Bonez don't, tell it to me dawg where the fuck you keep your damn money give it to me or!
Get your head blowed off by a sawed off shot got your broad lock-jawed cuz I don't like talk naw ughhh
So cold and ugly those who thought that Bonez was funny
Motivation only money C.R.E.A.M go and check it homie
Fuck 'em if they don't listen fuck 'em if they do not agree
Fuck it I'm all outta time, fuck I did this shit for free

Focus on up for the camera, bang to the fullest my family out her like bruh
Desicivaluate every moment I been awake I been open to competition they silly like what?
See I'm gone like flip it to rest, can compete with the best
Sold like empathy words demons all in my chest
Open the guidelines, they pop eye tugging at best toatin' ammunition when I get it put em to the test, bitch
Solo the colo my homie denomination I'ma get it put intended
After the fact I'ma let 'em have it and damage em running right up on stage yelling dumbass silly rabbits
I don't mess with ether feed ya they label me a demon creature
I more then that fact fuck all your features and to be honest it wasn't nice to meet ya
Foot to face we can just called that creature, motherfuckas need to shut up and leave it to Beaver
I'm a focus mind frame so I cannot teach ya
Deliverance individual circumstances irrelevant
Everybody be full of shit don't you know what's barbiturates
Out of my mind filling the diligence, this is the shit that I gotta do because I don't give a fuck about any of your wits
I'm living off for the pain no one offers to gain not a feeling of the same
Tell em all to maintain duration of the same loyalty I'm able to stack up all of this manifest no reply it's obvious
Motherfuckas need to realize who started this I'm a cold piece of work and they feelings get hurt disaster bastard so they labeled me a jerk
My flow Richter write-offs kill Mufasa low range Mind Games got to show proper dance in the wind creep I'm a heat doctor ants in the pants mind just off my rocker
Time ain't  a factor that you can capture
Basic ain't a word that's a float cat turd you can't fuck with mine I'll beat you backwards flattering you say you rap I see actor
Hydrofluoric acid gonna eat your speakers as I SLAY!!
Beat whenever I'm coming to kill 'em all beat whatever they're calling it I'm feeling and darkness raising and taking it over
Think I'm made of dark matter entirely, that's why I'm charged with negativity, hyperactivity is the way I kill the beat, nevertheless I thought my verse would pull you down like a gravity making it impossible to out rap me
Unless you're fucking Savitar
Getting into the speed force annihilation is a matter of Corce
Shit I'm feeling the speed in my veins get your potion lip it dip it 'till you get your brain boiling motherfucker or back out motherfucker
Every time you tryna diss me I'ma be coming up 10 times harder I'ma me dominating over bitches who are trynna speed up their verses, I won't be giving a shit how you fellas claim to do 40 syllables in a single second, I'm at the intersection of being demon and OG of speedsters
Think I might be going in a killing mode
Why the fuck can't I get rid of voices? Tell me lord
Guess I gotta cope with a demon inside my soul, I just beat the shit out of my demon, his turn comes on
See that's the problem putting others first, you've taught them, you come second
(ROUND 7)
Murdering shredding up putting 'em in oven I'm ripping the flesh before cracking all bones just to die 'em all up fry 'em up finna eat them with a hot sauce with a ghost one
The only place you can get rid of me is in a parallel universe where I suck and these motherfuckers are trynna top out the game with em condoms on faces
Imma hit em with a metal, shit 'em with a mental slaughter 'em like a phantom make this shit look like it was accidental
You better believe I'm coming to beat 'em all in a godspeed battle
I could run up on you put a gun up on you but I will fuck you up in like a minute, admit it you can never be sicker than a wicked chopper
I'ma be the muhfucker who will knock you out of the beat you will never outbeat us if you think that speed is the key
And here I stand manifestation of pain with my brains popping revolution, it's atomic superfusion I'm just brainsick fruit that grew too ripe for mainstream tree
Verse 6:  {Hindi}
Na me soch saku kabhi na me karu kabhi please me hu boss mera khudhi naa me pause karu kabhi
Na me rakhta umeed to fhir loss kaise hoga mere paas kaafhi khubi mena bana kabhi choosey
Jo bhi mila mujhe bhot meto chala mere raah pe kyuki mila mujhe khot
Mere dostone choda kyuki paas na tha note mere faislone laaya mujhe yaahatak ab bhauk par baate na me karu kabhi tedhi
Tere gaaane lage wack kyuki mera feature nahi mujhe banna teacher nahi par me karu preach ab yahi
K he mera na koi tod kyuki mere gaane sahi mujhe taane dete wahi jisne nahi kiya kuch
Mere baate seedhe lage dil me jaake kabhi puch mujhe bandi kare text fhir me karu usse khush
Par me karu sabhi mess jab me smell karu douche par parwaah nahi tu kya soche mere baare
Garv ha he khudpe hi tu kya bole mere baare

Kidshot

Everytime I wanna sit, write something lit, I feel like I'm blocked and 'bout to end up in heaven
Or hell as well, I'm tired of this shit, but I'm happy I can split seconds in part seven
And I'm shouting it out, years seventeen, as I'm here I just wonder where I've been
All of this time while being so keen on the rhyme, now with lyrics so clean
I'm eating the lettuce and drinking Sprite, gon' leave you electrified, if you know what I mean
Do I really have to fight for what's right, not getting left with the hook to kill and a ruptured spleen?
Setting off the rhyme scheme, tryna go so rough for the underground scene
And I thank y'all for the love you show, though it seems like some wanna act tough behind the screen
Not at all 'bout this stuff and I really wanna scream when I see that motherfucker with a brain of a bean
Thinking like he's above everybody but his team, cannot use his ears and grey matter between
Keyboard warrior causing authorial euphoria as I fulfill my dream
When I gotta pretend like I shut my eyes and I cut off them guys like a guillotine
(Like I've never seen it) Rise above the hate, join them when they keep on going almost half of a decade
So I kept in disguise, owing you what I do great, it's been really not a lie since the 8th damn grade
When I made the "See Me Later" and I'm really not afraid of any hater making greater everything I create
Dedicated 'til I'm faded away, better don't stay (It would be like wishing to catch your fade)
Thinking about the negativity coming upon everything I made
But I can tell it's pretty dope and I really hope you feel the same
I'd rather make it not breaking the edge, I would instead want to gather a packet of syllables
That'd be worth all the time, meaning more than a mumble
Now let's get ready to rumble
'Cause I won't consider myself any bit of humble
Chopping like karate, when it comes to music, buddy
I won't stop being rowdy 'til my body will crumble

Startin everyday off feelin parched
Crackin open a bottle of sprite and writing some bars from Mars
Gettin me amped up like a rockstar
Sprite Beatz be leavin Mizury in misery from sun up to sun down strung out like a g-g-guitar
Addicted to the bass when the speakers hit me in the face so I gotta glue 'em into place
Strappin' them monsters down wit' chains
'Cause Sprite be makin' me catch a case when showin' off the music then puttin' brusies and leavin' everyone of my fans in pain
The IC series insane in the membrane twisted wit' the words and mergin' them into verses strainin' when surfin' thru ya brain
We playin' it like a arcade; lyricism be the game engraving and markin' ya mindframe when marchin' it like a parade
Pulsating thru the veins put a motherfucker in a seizure
Rappin' that strobe light rap wit' light speed choppin' it up wit a cleaver
Dragon breathers spittin' ether
Mouthpieces be the heaters wit' a god made delivery like every track is dropped on Easter
Like how many SPS was that bro? Fuck, I don't know shit man I just rap
Then set back and laugh watchin' y'all debate if I sped it up so- HHRRRRRAAAHHHHHH, how was that?
Cash me outside, how bow dah mad whitey I'll attack and bitch smack any one of you faggots and set yo' ass strait
My name isn't Mac Lethal fuckers so you better know ya place and I dont speed up my videos like he does either so you better get the fuck outta my face
Rockin' out wit the cock out so gone and bow down and suck it I'm custom wit' the rhymes I'm bustin' callin' the flow seductive
Ridin' the beat like percussion when I'm rushin' 'em given a beat a concussion when I hit it up wit' syllables by the dozen like its nothin'
When I'm bustin' gettin' ya girls pussy gushin' when I'm thrustin' and fuckin'
The production stuffin' it and nuttin' miz babies all over the beat; beat it up given it some mad whitey sensual lovin'
When I'm runnin' up stayin' pumpin' like a fuckin' rhino porno whenever I be humpin'
I make more moves; then a pornstar
I've been on more tracks; then fuckin NASCAR
I stay in service more then AT&T wit' them bars
Dream on
Ahhhhhhhhhhh

Sono un persona pragmatica, do lezioni di grammatica
Quindi parto da subito con la mia potenza massima
Ho dovuto fare la pratica, per questo che vado a raffica
In automatica cambio la tattica e spacco la natica
Non dire che non sono bravo se non sai fare di meglio
Se davvero tu fossi in grado di farlo, tanto di cappello
So che ho trovato il risultato solo mettendoci l'impegno
Vi distruggo, drammaturgo molto più di Pirandello
Dicono "Tu sei onesto" dopo che sentono un mio pezzo perché ho già visto buio pesto con la luce delle cicale
Testo più complesso, bevo succo fresco e rappo tutto questo testo fino a quando tu ti senti male
Non me ne fotte un cazzo, te l'ho già detto in ogni modo, te l'ho già detto in ogni luogo e pure in ogni situazione
Quando arrivo prendo lo spazio, guarda quanto cazzo volo, è diventato il mio lavoro far ballare le persone
Prendo posizione al contrario degli ignavi
Se vuoi la mia prestazione, te la faccio se mi paghi
Senza giubbotto in moto fuori meno sei gradi
Duri poco quando sputo tutto il fuoco dei draghi
Sardo, pazzo, sanno quanto valgo, la mia scimmia che fuma è un orangotango
Voglio un posto tipo da comando, mangio mango, ballo tango barcollando
Arrivo in paradiso facendo rime stupende
Sono così preciso che non puoi dire più niente
Non ho un bunker, ma comunque sono un tipo prudente
Arrivo subito al dunque con un testo pungente
Senti una mia canzone dopo la rimetti in play
Arrivo con Twisted Insane e con più fighe di Drake
E con più stile di Ray, facciamo impazzire gli dei
Voi ci arrivate in ritardo come dopo mille delay
Dopo di me col fast rap non ce n'è, mister Flash on the track I'm back and blessed
Sono nato bianco con la testa black
Non sono mai stanco vivo senza stress, flex
Tutto quello che faccio non lo posso dimenticare
Tutto quello che ho guadagnato me lo posso rimeritare
Questo programma l'ho craccato, cambiato, riprogrammato
Se sbaglio, lo faccio da capo, è il mio modo di registrare

Don't you ever come around and try to take me out my spot
Or in a box is where ya body gonna rest at
You wanna bet that, then I'm a do you like a crab
Pull ya limbs with my knee in ya back 'till ya chest crack
Hella insane when the main vein spray I don't gang bang
But I'm down to rumble if somebody want smoke
Let it blow 'till the barrel swinging outta control
Showing you that Sinizter is not a joke
I can rhyme with the best
Palm on ya neck squeeze 'till ya face turn blue and eyes start to sweat
I am live in the flesh you can die from the TEC
Like butter how it slide through ya vest you a mess
Kinda new but I kick it like a vet
Running to the  studio to lace another track so I can flip check
Anybody sleeping on me better come at me correct
Every track that I put up I only hit nothing but net
PME, I'm a boss with a vision
Like I was enlisted walking through the desert on a mission
Am I dead or livin', if I'm livin' I'm a keep on kicking 'till my goal met
Tell me how you gonna keep ya head up with a broken neck
Motherfucker listen I got the light to ignite the propane
You'll die from slow pain I'll slice a throat vein, you dying foe fame
But fail to see, that you gon' take L's and bleed you are still lame it won't change
I'm ready to ride, you ready to die, ready fly to the sky and see if heaven is live
Underground chopper with a chopper throwing lead in ya side
Spitting these devilish lines deep in my head I'm Divine
Who wanna scrap, who wanna rap I've been with the smoke
All of ya styles the same someone invented a clone
We are defending the throne walking on into ya home
Seeing how much pressure 'till you break while I'm bending ya bones
I will die for this I grind for this I'll rhyme till my tonsils split so stop ya shit
You gonna need binoculars when I ascend
And if I fall, I rise again I'll beat the odds I got to win
I go hard in paint, all in ya face, keep a metal arm on my waist
Won't hesitate to left it off and clear the back of a skull
There ain't no laughing it off, Undaground Choppers clear a drum then we gone

You've awakened a dragon I'm spitting of the fire and Flame
When I'm rapping and setting a blaze that will cover the canvas at last
I will burn them and turn them to ashes that's that
Raisin Hell from the underground you sucker clowns are in trouble now
I don't hear a single word in your verse all you do is!#%$^*&@$!%& making
Mumble sounds
Better make way I be busting through untamable off the leash and I'm running loose
VBL in the flesh there is no substitute
I been doing this believe me, it's nothing new
On the track I be taking advantage like slipping a pill in your drink Something like Dr. Huxtable just when they thought they were safe and got comfortable I storm like Thunderbolts
They are be trying to rap really fast and they say their time
Traveling, I quantum tunnel though
I am a jumper don't you know I'm jumping through portals and get where I wanna go
Buzzing off brew when I'm drinking Old English and this is my drunken flow
But it's still wonderful
(Maximus Russell Crowe)
I'm a gladiator that'll wrestle alligators
Then I gotta copy and I show up at your territory attacking you like a Raider
You cannot hold me like I'm a hot potato never want to be the greatest but I'm major
I got rhythm and precision like a laser, I'm a lyrical razor
And I could separate the Earth at the equator
You can't stop this apocalypse so you better say your prayers sayonara see you later
Laughing at you cuz you're just still a buster
Corry you suck but your rhyme are filled with nothing but a bunch of filibusters!
And that is poor, very
Trying to chop when you rhyme like TEC 9 but you're just sounding like Little Donnie from the Thornberrys

SplytSecond is synonymous with superior syllable slinging insinuating saliva stay smooth
Son of Sam sharp shooter soliloquy similarly slithering so saddiddy spitters say soothe
I'm a master with rappin' it's not a car accident when I crack the whip
You wack and still ask me for respect you get NONE like a Catholic pacifist practicing abstinence
And since you don't screw I'ma neuter you as a chopper vet I guess it is my duty too
You haven't the courage to bark at my dawgs so go and get a Blues Clue Scooby-doo
From every continent the choppers will be coming from number 7 never meant to be a one and done
Yeah better believe it and there is a reason that I am on every single one of em
Some of the people that're creepin' wit' cannons affiliated with bonitas that're speakin' in Spanish
Trading a stack of the moolah for the weed and the cannabis and be walking around with a heater just to keep an advantage
But I was never viva la vida but lethal and famished unable to rest for a millisecond if you rest so many people could vanish
Not even the reaper could stand it a freakin' insanity plea for the planet when I flee I'll be leavin a can and then BOOM
Homicidal when hit em in the organs that're vital you been invited to the recital when i be choppin it harder and harder
Scatterin parts of the body all over the party forget a bicardi you're gonna want a bottle of water the moment I started to slaughter
Double S and Double helix equal to double the chromosomes I'm comin to put it down when you listen to the sound
Of an M1 Vulcan raring and ready to riddle you rappers with another round
Turn to the other way to earn what I double pay and learn that whatever's gonna turn up another day
Part of me mechanical saliva that's flammable everybody in the crowd is gonna burn up in front of me
Sickness is deadly this is the remedy I am just what all these posers pretend to be
Sprite lay the track I'm cementing my legacy of the Undaground chopper that I will forever be6Embed
