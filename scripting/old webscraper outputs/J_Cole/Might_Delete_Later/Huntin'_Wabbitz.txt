Shh
Be very, very quiet
I'm huntin' wabbits
Goddamn (Uh)

Fuck runnin' in place, I'd never do that, my destination is runnin' the map
I'll run in your trap like, "Run me your work 'fore somebody get hurt," nigga, run or get clapped
I ain't cool with these dudes, I don't fool with these dudes
I don't wanna show love, I don't wanna give dap
I just wanna kick back, take trips, make hits, make big chips, stack 'til they tall as Kristaps
Me and your squad is mismatch
Your calves ain't strong enough to follow his path
And you know the bitch bad if I brought the bitch back
Let the chick ride stick like I taught her witchcraft
Caught a whiplash when they saw the whip pass
They like, "Okay, I see you," bitch, how could you not?
I drove to CVS, copped a Plan B and I watched as she swallowed, bitch, I kid you not
Can't take no risk in this game, my money grew, but my ambition's the same
Talk to me proper, you lookin' like Q at the locker, I pop up how Bishop had came
What's up? Niggas gon' put some respect on my name
One way or another
I work the whole winter to take over summer
They late to the party 'cause they overslumbered
Don't hop on it now, nigga, stay over yonder
I'm on Rodeo, I'm bummy
I'm 'bout to get fly like my layover comin'
I promise I don't feel a day over twenty
They hatin' from so far away and it's funny
I'm clappin' at niggas like they owe me money
Pop-pop-pop-pop-pop-pop, click
Shit, now the clip lookin' like Chick-fil-A on a Sunday
You might also like
He keeps killing us, father
He keeps taking and taking
I want to—

Pop in a new one and let off again
Always knew we was gon' get our revenge
Aim at whoever ain't dead, I will win
You thought 'cause I'm god of this rap shit that I'd just forget all the sins?
Oh, how you wish
He dope as a hundred and ten-hour binge
Everybody say that they start at the bottom
I don't care to doubt 'em, but this how it ends, nigga
Look at you, son
Look at what you've become
This how it ends
Never see no one get this high again
Globetrotter shit, bitch, that's just how I spin
Word to my palm, bitch, I'm too locked in
I hit 'em up, bitch, I'm 2Pac twin
Came up 'round sharks, so that's just how I swim
Came up 'round sharks, so that's just how I swim
(That's just how I swim)
This how it ends
Never see no one get this high again
Globetrotter shit, bitch, that's just how I spin
Word to my palm, bitch, I'm too locked in
I hit 'em up, bitch, I'm 2Pac twin
Came up 'round sharks, so that's just how I swim
Came up 'round sharks, so that's just how I swim
I'm sorry
I'm so sorry for what I've done3Embed
