Tears for ODB, drug-induced poetry
What’s the use? Strung-out from that drug abuse, woe is me
80's baby, so I know my pops was gettin’ high
In the 90's, me and mama barely gettin’ by
2000's I was concentratin’ more on gettin’ fly
Gettin’ bitches, gettin’ rich to get the shit I couldn’t buy
You know the story, you know my allegory
I was sent from Heaven with a set of horns, they’d better warn y’all
I’m here for more than just to kick some witty metaphors, dawg
This more of the type of shit you spit to set a war off
‘Cause niggas be poor, get money and still don’t know
Why the fuck they can’t cop a house, the system meant to lock us out
But I’m knockin’ down the door, strapped up with a four-four
Robin Hood, shit and yeah, I’m ‘hood rich
That’s good enough to stay in new kicks and a good whip
Get good head from a good bitch, I give two shits, I’ma tell you straight up

Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
But I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
You might also like
Lord have mercy on my soul, what I’ve done and what I’ve seen
My life has tumbled into that which only you could intervene
I put my heart in senseless things: money, bitches and street shit
Fascinated by beef, sad to say I won’t be shit
Grew up in this bitch without a pot to piss, no toilet
How ironic, I took a lot of shit, like a bottom bitch
Or a model chick, high off coke
They lockin’ sons up for less, I don’t care how y’all cope
But yet I still peddle this dope and these pills
I’ll never know how sittin’ comfy on that Oprah seat feels
More than likely be on Most Wanted posters, we still
Holdin’ on to old dreams of bein’ Hova, be real
We the forgotten souls, bottom of the totem poles
Left for dead, some niggas fled, people say they sold their souls
I just think they found a better way, Lord knows I never pray
But sometimes I be wishin’ I could levitate, I’ll take it straight up

Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
But I’m just tryna make it
Straight up
Straight up
Straight up, aye, any chance I’ma take it
Rather die before I fake it
They say life is what you make it, bitch
Hey, hey
Cole World
2-6 Fayettenam shit
For all my niggas still going through it
Yeah
Straight up
My niggas gotta learn something
It's 2012 nigga
And we're still killing ourselves
You don't know by now nigga
You ain't gon' never know
