Oh-oh, it doesn't matter if he doesn't want you
Because everybody has that person
Yeah, just know that you still deserve it
You deserve the love that you don't have, mm
He may not, oh, but someone does, yeah, mm
Someone loves you, somewhere out there
They're waiting, yeahSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $156You might also likeEmbed
