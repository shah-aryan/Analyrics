2 ContributorsDowntown Lyrics
Oh Nah Oh Nah Nah Nah Nothing Here Is Good For Me Oh
Nah Nah Oh Nah Yall Dont Understand What We Could Be
Only Want One Chance When We Could See It I Just Wanna
Touch The Sky Yeah I Just Wanna Touch The Sky Yeah

Call Her My Everything Call Her My Sweetheart Know What I like and perfect street smarts go in on the track even if they
Dont think the beat hard I can already see you far away touch
The star today guess what that other dude was talking about
Wasn't important crew love on the beach and on the carpet
Welcome to new Orleans Saying I Love You Was On The List
According I'm Sure Of It I Know Last Time Things Was Falling
Apart Money Going Low To Large Lets Just Thank God For
What We Have Tryna Get My Money In The Stash Lets Just
Go Slow They Don't See Us In The Past

Oh Nah Oh Nah Nah Nothing Here Is Good For Me Oh Nah Nah
Oh Nah Yall Dont Understand What We Could Be Only Want
One Chance When We Could See It I Just Wanna Touch The
Sky Yeah I Just Wanna Touch The Sky Yeah

I Know Things'll Get Better I Just Found Taylor Swift Let
The Haters Drift All I Shouldn't Even Asked You Girl Hope
Yo Last Got Past You Girl Why Why I'm Kind Of Mad At
You Girl Push That To The Side No Brain Tonight I Bring
The Light He Bring Them Lies Well I Lied A Lot But I'm
Being Honest Now I Can Change Everything I Promise
Now  And That Other Dude Looking At The Sonic Wow
Damn Everybody Suffered That Time What Was Yall
Thinking Hope It's Not What Were Yall Drinking

Oh Nah Nah Oh Nah Yall Dont Understand What
We Could Be Only Want One Chance When We
Could See It I Just Wanna Touch The Sky I Just

I Know You've Ben Running On Empty Why Did You Send Me
Lets Make Some Changes Not The Motto To The Game Nobody
Changed It Money Ain't In The Air Baby It Ain't Raining I Ain't
Faking If This What's Gonna Occur Then I Won't Take It
Never Had No Love But You Didn't Either Until Now Talk
To Me Girl How You Feel Now You Finer Than Beautiful
On A Real Girl Your Heart Is Priceless Make Me Wanna Steal
Girl Sit It Down Lay It Down Know What You Mean Just
Chill Girl

Oh Nah Yall Dont Understand What We Could Be Only Want
One Chance When We Could See It I Just Wanna Touch The
Sky I Just Wanna Touch The Sky
