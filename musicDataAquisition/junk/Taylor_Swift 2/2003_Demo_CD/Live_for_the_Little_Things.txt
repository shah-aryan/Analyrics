10 ContributorsTranslationsFran√ßaisLive for the Little Things Lyrics
One daybreak, one heartache
Every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things
Ohh, yeah
Ohh

No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

Na na na...
Oh, yeah
Na na na...
Ohh, yeah
Na na na...Embed
