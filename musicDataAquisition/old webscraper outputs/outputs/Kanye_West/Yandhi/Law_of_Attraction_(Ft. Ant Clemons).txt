Did you ever think of a dream too big to imagine?
Follow your passion, one day you'll face
The law of attraction, be careful what you ask for
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for
Put a stack on it, huh, put a MAC on it, huh
In the black on it, huh, bullet tracks on it, huh
And I'm black on ‘em, huh, and we back on ‘em, huh
On a map on ‘em, huh, got a stack on ‘em, oh
Hunnid thou’ on it, huh, hunnid stacks on it, huh
Hunnid been-backs on it, huh, to the max on it, huh
Dealin’ facts on it, huh, now my facts on it, huh
On the dacts on it, huh, all the facts on it, huh

Did you ever think of a dream too big to imagine?
Follow your passion, one day you'll face
The law of attraction, be careful what you ask for
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for

The world is up for seizin', there's somethin' for a reason
They just talk, don’t read it, I lead on some, nah, don’t lead it
More or so, what you leave with? I got somethin' for you to leave with
What they tell 'em, don't believe it
Tell me what you believe in, tell me what you believe in
Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto, we in a game, we in a game
Grand Theft Auto, Grand Theft Auto, we all the same, we all the same
Money ain't real, time ain't real, money ain't real, time ain't real
Money ain't real, time ain't real, guess to what, you never get killed
Did you ever think of a dream too big to imagine?
Follow your passion, one day you'll face
The law of attraction, be careful what you ask for
Means I got what I asked for, exactly what I asked for

Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh
