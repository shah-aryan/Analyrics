7 ContributorsStronger (Live from VH1 Storytellers) Lyrics
When people come at me a certain type of way, uh, I forget them for
They base their opinions merely on what they were taught
You know, what they were given, what their parents taught them
You hear that? When you see this ain't, that- that's not nothing
They will never be anything and you know, I'm a pretty good dartboard 'cause I can take it
I'm a easy target, 'cause I don't fit in
I think through the gate, you know
From The College Dropout when I was the only person with a polo in the midst of a whole bunch of jerseys
That I was the, the difference
And I realized that I'm not just fighting a battle just for myself, but for a generation
You know, a generation fighting against the false information of the media
And the perceptions that people create in the matrix that society creates in the lies that people tell, and the-
And the laughs and the jokes that people tell all the way back in a high school lunch room
All the way to when you know, you're older, and anyone that decides to walk their own path as ostracize
And um, you know, you have to be stronger in that situation and that's- that's one of my main goals that they don't kill me can only can only make me stronger

Let's get lost tonight
You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
And you don't give a fuck what they all say, right?
Awesome, the Christian in Christian Dior
Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
I ask, ‘cause I'm not sure
Do anybody make real shit anymore?
Bow in the presence of greatness
‘Cause right now thou hast forsaken us
You should be honored by my lateness
That I would even show up to this fake shit
So go ahead, go nuts, go apeshit
'Specially in my Pastellé, on my Bape shit
Act like you can't tell who made this
New Gospel, homie, take six
And take this, haters!

N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Is this what you've been waiting for?!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–

I don't know if you got a man or not
If you made plans or not
If God put me in your plans or not
I'm trippin', this drink got me saying a lot
But I know that God put you in front of me
So how the hell could you front on me?
There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment, right?
‘Cause it's Louis Vuitton Don night
So we gon' do everything that Kan like
Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
Well, I'd do anything for a blonde dyke
And she'll do anything for the limelight
And we'll do anything when the time's right
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
Uh, baby, you're makin' it
N-now th-that that don't kill me
Can only make me stronger
I need you to hurry up now
‘Cause I can't wait much longer
I know I got to be right now
‘Cause I can't get much wronger
Man, I've been waiting all night now
Is this what you've been waiting for?!
Work it harder, make it better
Do it faster, makes us stronger
(I need you right now!)
More than ever, hour after hour
Work–
(I need you right now!)

Go to the drums, go to the drums

You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya
Don't act like I never told ya1Embed
