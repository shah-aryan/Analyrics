5 ContributorsWorkout Plan (Live at Abbey Road Studios) Lyrics
Let's go!
One, and two, and three, and four, and get them sit-ups right, and
Tuck your tummy tight and do your crunches like this
Give–, stop, breathe, get up, check your weave
Don't drop the blunt and disrespect the weed
Pick up your son and don't disrespect your seed
It's a party tonight and ooh, she's so excited
Tell me who's invited: you, your friends and–
Uh, what's scary to me
Henny makes girls look like Halle Berry to me
So excuse me miss, I forgot your name
Thank you, God bless you, good night, I came
I came, I came, I came

Now, it's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she's talkin' 'bout freakin' out
Baby, we can work it out
C'mon, work it out, let me hear you say, work it out
Let me hear you say (Work it out)
I gotta hear you say (Work it out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say what? (Maybe we can work it out)
Ooh, girl, your silhouette make me wanna light a cigarette
My name Kanye from the Jigga set, Twista said, "Get It Wet"
Ooh, girl, your breath is harsh
Cover your mouth up like you got SARS
Off them tracks, yeah, I bought them cars
Still kill a nigga on 16 (Bars)
We ain't sweating to the oldies, we juking to a cold beat
Maybe one day, girl, we can bone
So you can brag to all your homies (Now)
But I still mess with a big girl, if you ain't fit, girl, I'll still hit it, girl
One and, you brought two friends
Okay, three more, now hop in the Benz
Four-door: do y'all know the difference between a five, six– uh
Say, all the mocha lattes, you gotta do Pilates
You gotta pop this tape in 'fore you start back datin'
Hustlers, gangstas, all us ballers, uh

It's been a week without me
And she feel weak without me
She wanna talk it out but
Ain't nothin' to talk about
Unless she talkin' 'bout freakin' out
Then maybe we can work it out
C'mon, work it out, let me hear you say (Work it out)
I need to hear you say (Work it out)
I gotta hear you say (Work it out now)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, say what? (Maybe we can work it out)You might also likeEmbed
