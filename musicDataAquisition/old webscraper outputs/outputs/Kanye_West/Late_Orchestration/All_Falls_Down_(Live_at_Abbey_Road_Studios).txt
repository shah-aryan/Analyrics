6 ContributorsAll Falls Down (Live at Abbey Road Studios) Lyrics
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, this the real one, baby
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
London, stand up!
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Southside
We gon' set this party off right
We set this party off right or what?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Okay, that's it

Man, I promise, she's so self-conscious
She has no idea what she doin' in college
That major that she majored in don't make no money
But she won't drop out, her parents'll look at her funny
Now, tell me that ain't insecurr
The concept of school seems so securr
Sophomore, three yurrs, ain't picked a carurr
She like, "I'll just stay down hurr and do hair"
That's enough money to buy her a few pairs
Of new Airs, her baby daddy don't really care
She's so precious with the peer pressure
Couldn't afford a car, so she named her daughter Alexis
Had hair so long that it looked like weave
She cut it all off, now she look like Eve
She dealin' with some issues that you can't believe
Single black female addicted to retail, and well
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Everybody say, "All falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Let me hear you sing
And when it falls down
Oh, when it all

Man, I promise, I'm so self-conscious
That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches
Rollie's and Pasha's done drove me crazy
I can't even pronounce nothin', pass that Ver-say-see!
Then I spent four hundred bucks on this (For real)
Just to be like, "Nigga, you ain't up on this"
And I can't even go to the grocery store
Without some Ones that's clean, a shirt with a team
It seem we livin' the American Dream
But the people highest up got the lowest self-esteem
The prettiest people do the ugliest things
For the road to riches and diamond rings
We shine because they hate us, floss 'cause they degrade us
We tryna buy back our forty acres
And for that paper, look how low we'll stoop
Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coupe
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Come on, everybody say, "All falls down"
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
I can't hear you!
And when it all falls down
Oh, when it all

I say, "–– the police," that's how I treat 'em
We buy our way out of jail, but we can't buy freedom
We'll buy a lot of clothes, but we don't really need 'em
Things we buy to cover up what's inside
'Cause they made us hate ourself and love they wealth
That's why shorty's hollerin', "Where the ballers at?"
Drug dealer buy Jordan, crackhead buy crack
And George Bush get paid off of all of that
But I ain't even gon' act holier than thou
Fuck it, I went to Jacob with 25 thou
Before I had a house and I'd do it again
I wanna be on 106 & Park, pushin' a Benz
I want to act ballerific like it's all terrific
I got a couple past-due bills, I won't get specific
I got a problem with spendin' before I get it
We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Yeah, now everybody say
And when it falls down, who you gon' call now?
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
Now let me hear you say
And when it all falls down
Oh, when it all, it all falls down
Let's go, let's go, lemme hear you say
One more time, one more time
I'm tellin' you all, it all falls down
From the front to the back, say
And when it all falls downYou might also likeEmbed
