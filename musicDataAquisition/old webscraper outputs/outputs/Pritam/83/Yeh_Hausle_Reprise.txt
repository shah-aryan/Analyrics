Rap Boy 

Ready?
Go!

I fucked your bitch
I'm gay

That's facts
Take it like truth
You a Rap Boy so I don't like you
When I go on YouTube I ain't seen shit worth watchin'
So I leave so I can jerk my dick
Nobody ever really heard my shit
So I guess that's it this a 10/10

We need a beat

Subsy hit me on my
Discord but he is a bitch so
He know I'm a fucking
Rap Boy
You might also likeGod damn got the world in my hand sanitizer
I'm a fuckin womanizer
Yea Imma
Rap Boy
Got coke in my coat I eloped with a dope bitch
You already know this Imma
Rap Boy
Ramsey like I'm Gordon
Mario Kartin'

Motherfucking Rap Boy

Let's get this shit 

Sponge down in Bikini Bottom teeny bottoms hittin' me up like they ain't givin' a fuck
And the SGAP chat put me in a hazmat suit when the Wu flu hit mе like a truck full a bricks
Imma suck on my dick with some measuring tapе attached to my damn face and it feels so scrape-y
Ain't me on the verse this just my doppelganger I fuck a hater and slam these tater
Tots how many bars that's a lot
Vigilante had me all caught
Pussy!

When he saw me drivin' in my Audi blastin' the Rap Boy at full volly

P-P-Pussy!

Ballin' with my crew
What you fuckin do when you see us pray to your Jesus

Motherfucking Rap Boy

That's me that's all us like fuck we spittin' these bars in the Toys "R" Us

Ikea's really great
I like going there
I love it so much
You can buy a nice chair
Ideas on my plate
But all I do is stare
Forget Rap Boy
I'll just hit the state fair
I don't ever want to hear about where your head's at
Popping out a novel and a half through a headset
I want you you to book a round-trip with your fist
Pop a fat lip, it's okay to wanna get your head wet, dude
I been aching every minute of the day
For the last decade, tryna rack my brain
Thinking maybe there's some shit I wanna spit some day
But everybody and their buddy wanna gatekeep
I'm a Rap Boy; you don't wear the moniker unless you gotta
Peddle on a popular property that people fawning on
Like a flavor of the week, checking out that cheese
Then they're gonna wanna leave
But I stand my ground while I'm digging to the center of the Earth
To the center of my soul, every little bit of worth
If I get a little cold, if I get a little hurt
I'mma make it to the hole, check it out, head first

Rap Boy, she look at me like a EyeToy
Bottom's up, red cup, like a boy boy
When I sleep I'm sleeping with one eye
Open
You got a nice house, yeah I broke in
Stole all your stuff and I'm walkin'
I didn't turn off your oven
Now your whole house is smokin'

Got drip like waffles
Got drip like Rap Boy
Got drip like wallscroll
Got drip like pancakes

A-A-A-ATOMIC

I’m a psychopath, don’t fuck with me
I’ll eat your ass and make you squee
You got eyelids like wet toilet paper
I’ll make your mind boil like water vapor
Bitch lookin’ at me like I got pancakes? (Pancakes)
I’ll be fucking with her and making the earth quake (Yuh)
I’m a Rap Boy and the best boy
And a fat boy and a game boy
And a big boy I’m a good boy
And a town boy and a weather boy
I’m a ball boy and a tall boy
And a pool boy and a pretty boy
And a cool boy I’m a poor boy
And the best boy and a Rap Boy

Oh hi, it's me
My name is Goat
No lie, no boy
Just a rap ho
What's that you say?
This is too slow?
Then wind me up
And watch me go!
Like clockwork I'm ballin'
Your mom I been callin'
For all the delicious
Cookies she bakes
Always
Don't worry just playing
She ain't my type though
Only love ponies and all of my
Hoooooomieeees!
Man, where the Rap Boy at?
Rap Boy! Rap Boy! Rap Boy! RRRAP BOY!

From day one I’ve been a Mooster through and through
From Kittykat to Rap Boy that’s how I do
These ain’t no Hunger Games cuz we got Vintage Beef
Meet me in the arena and I’ll wreck you at spleef
I’ll oppose you, depose you, suppose you’ll cry
I’ll knock your Fallen Kingdom right out of the sky
Feelin’ like Tobuscus how I nugget in her biscuit
We can 1v1 if you think you can risk it
But in the End I’m dragon my nuts ’cross your face
I’m taking my Revenge, and I’ll put you in your place

I’m a Rap Boy, I started this whole project
I spat it out when Slim Shady called me a ****** (oof)
Yeah Yeah, Rap boy
Fish koi, fish koi
I don’t fuck with no fish, fish boy
You're just a fish boy, a koi boy, soy boy
On my dick boy
I don’t give a shit about
I’m fuck a fuck about
You’re not a Rap Boy, I’m a Rap Boy, yeah
And I’m not a boy but I’m still a Rap Boy
I’m gonna fuck, I’m gonna fuck, I’m gonna put this down
I’m the man, man, I’m the fuckin’ boy man
I’m the Rap Boy, I’m the fuckin’ Rap Man
I’m the Rap Boy, I’m the fuckin’ Rap Man
I ain’t British, no fish and chips
No fish and chips
Only fish I eat is brown trout
Brown trout, that’s a call-back
Shoutout-
 (Reprise)
ATOMIC

Yo, Samsung Galaxy S2
This is the best phone for YouTube
Playing SGaP S2
It makes me say “ew”
But only pt. 2, not Untitled 2!
Pirate Boyz be saying “Ahoy”
But I be spitting cuz this is RAP BOY
I love this rap beat
Just kidding it’s weak
Just kidding it’s ₥eat
It makes me stomp my feet!

Rollin’ poison joke and makin’ that money
Smoking so much gas with Izzy and Sunny
Pull up to the con with an oz zip
Even Tree and Flutter are taking a rip
Unironically regressing back to '09
Infecting my PC, downloading music online
Rap Boy I guess but I’m pretty shit
At least I can draw, but that’s pretty much it

Winter cold breeze, blowing on the outside
And we up here in the North, staying in to hide
I'm just try'na get around, walking on the ice
But the whole Rap Boy crew's here, bringin' on the spice
All these players around try'na show off their power
Hey, I'm just here writing bars under an hour
No, I ain't braggin' much (no sweat), I'm just coming in clutch
And after we're done you'll be walkin' around needing a crutch

Bulk Bogan is dummy thicc
SpinScissor is dummy thicc
The pony listening is dummy thicc
Your mom and dad are also thicc
Not an imitation like crab meat
I'm covered in butter, so come try and grab me
Canterlot cops always tryna stab me
One in the neck and one in the back of me
You probably eat at Arby's
I'm a brony, I don't play with Barbies
I think I just ran out of luck
I suited a deer and got ran over by a truck
I guess you could say that I suck
That's a realistic postulation, I guess I kinda ruined
Rap Boy, Rap Boy, Rap Boy, Rap Boy

God dang
Hot dog

Fam, this beat is fire, I can't wait to rap on it fam
Only once, fam, first try you know what I mean, like?
No second tries, no third tries
I do things right, I do 'em once, okay fam?
Let's go, you ready? Alright let's do this!

(Unintelligible)
 (Cont.)
Call me Damn Daniel, pull up in a white van
Call the police, Rap Boy nicks your whole fam
"Free V-Bucks" graffitied on the side
You might as well give up, fam, and hop inside

Squeaking like I'm ratboy genius
Pullin' on my Rap Boy pingas
Acting like I never seen ya
I can't even hear a thing ya
Shame it must be mental illness
Must've forgot daily pill this
Isn't what it really feels like
When I'm all by myself chillin'
In the Discord voicechat muted
You can try all that communi-
-cate with me until I fall asleep it's
Never too early to give me peace

RAP BOY RAP BOY
I’m in 125, eatin’ Sponch
Gotta say my grace, before my lunch
You gotta query bro? Consult the conch
We crash the racist room, and then we launch
Into mane stage and we gonna start a riot
Start a fuckin’ mosh, gonna see the crowd dyin’
Gettin’ thirsty, water resupplyin’
Stir the cauldron, crowd be complyin’
But then we had to buy a scroll, sit down at the ponydrome
Watching AnimatedJames see him stinking up the place
Dressed up like a sexy elf, raised esteem for myself
Had to sing without a stage, had to scream in rage
Toasty and sodasac in the Pilk room
Goin’ kamehameha on his Yamaha, then we finish off the night with Scrimshaw
I really liked going to trot with you guys, but I think I’m gay now, you turned me gay

Rap Boy
Well goddamn I don't fuck with it
Talkin bout the rules, quit suckin it
Talkin bout the dick of the proclaimed king
Add another decree and we stuck with it
I don't really wanna say it but i feel like i have to
I don't really wanna leave when i already have you
But you leave me no choice, I won't live with the tyranny
Acting all righteous but fucking us dearly (Huah)
I promise you that i have had enough
Sayin you the ruler when the goin's gettin’ rough
Well you know we tough and we won't back down
We gon’ find a way around it cause this shit is fuckin’ clowning
Sounding, like a brown-nosed goon lounging
Hounding, on my girls and boys who play around it's
Astounding, all the times we put in the work
But get shut down cause the tyrant is feeling butthurt (Yuh)
Feelin kinda tired bitch I might sleep
If you don't get it that's ok cause these bars is deep
I don't often participate but I do be creepin’
Throwback, all i gotta say is you will sow what you reapin’ (Unh)
You feel?

Heyo it’s Chuckles
So buckle in
And get comfy
No point in your running from me
I marathon on this bop
Boys hit the room, and we boisterous
Noise hits like boom, twenty voices
Toymaker cruisin' Rolls Royces
Filled up with clop
Top tier terrific
When I spit this
On a mix this
Wicked sick and
Call me Triscuit
Great and powerful
And fully up to mischief
Fabulous and braggadocios
Half capricious half emotion
Half as rad as Trixie
Lulamoon but less than half as hopeless
Me and my boys are scary
Flatten you like boysenberry
Pancakes at the IHOP
And I’ll take your high top
Chucks cause when I rap, boy
Punch like Applejack boy
Rush like Rainbow Dash boy
Chuckles on the track boy

Rap Boy, 'bouta click click pow, yeah
I'm feelin' a little sick right now
Sit right down, my raps are too ill
You can barely compare to my level of skill
Sorry if I sound a little nasally
But it's plain to see
You other rappers can't compare to me
It's unfair to be next to me
So I'm cooking up rhymes while I'm coughing up a lung
You can barely find time to untie your tongue
Got an infection, I'm viral
Come kickin' down your drywall
Name's Kyle, yeah I'm wild

SOUND BANDIT, I'll manage
To wreck a track, leave damage
Outstandin', command it
You flip the track, then pan it
Watch my manoeuvres
Go choose a lane; I drive through yours
Ya, ya
Beset by shootas
Rap Cuchulainn, I stab through yas
Ya, ya
Too poor, couldn't pay for porridge
Those times always kept me honest
Rap boy in pursuit of knowledge
That boy is for sure a promise
It won't break for the money or the fame
All these rappers, now hunnid more the same
Its yo fate and I hunt 'em all the same
Got 'em packin', they runnin' from the pain

Rap Boy, got a pickaxe and a shovel gonna craft boy
A real diamond in the rough, no cap boy
Gonna rap I got game like Minecraft and Mine...Craft
Trust me, you don't wanna PVP
Got a record, in spleef casualties
Rap Boy, na na na na na na na na na na
Rap Boy, Rap... Boy...

Oh shoot sorry that I'm late I must've got the date wrong
Big thanks to Bulk for still letting me get onto this song
Anyway have you guys heard about this game called Windjammers 2?
You can play as Steve Miller who's also known as B. Yoo
It's the game that taught me 8bitdo don't work with PlayStation
It's winter right now so all the bears are in hibernation
They put violence in Pokemon, kick Jenny and slap Joy
Rap boy

Dropped a couple Malteser
Call a guy to check my floor from the forties
The insulation asbestos-y man
Always trying as best as he can
Takes a crack at it
Breathes that shit in like a crack addict
And still recounts that best sweet aroma
On account of his mesothelio-my
God. He’s cracked
The bod, he’s racked
Deployed, a track
The boy of rap
He’s spitting out lyrics in crystalline structures
The asbestos blood-rate has never been as much as
Present inside of this optimum specimen
Get a Rap Boy hoodie to dress him in


You can call me Rap Boy, you know I'm rappin'
You can call me Slap Boy, 'cuz I be slappin'
You can call me Wipe Boy, 'cuz I be wipin'
Yeah front-to-back, bitch, back-to-front
Bitch, I don't give a fuck which way you wipe
As long as the asshole is clean when I lick and it's nice, yuh
I don't give a fuck, wipe whichever way you want
Uh


I'm a child of rap, that's a fact
Never learned to talk, but with rap I can act
Guess I'm cracked
But things are on track
Got a dad, glad I do, name's Eminem
I figured you'd heard of him
Found out that's a lot to live up to
But y'all know that I still love him
(In school…) Rap Boy was what they called me
Back before I was on TV
At first it felt mean, these teens
Making me feel like I had no dreams
One day I clued up, they were just green
Right then I said fuck it, Rap Boy's on the scene
That was 20 years ago
A different story now
Me and dad get on OK I guess but
(beer bottle smash)
…not again

I just don't know where I went wrong
Ding dong
Were my rhymes too good?
Was the music too hood?
Something in his food?
Could the rap just be in my... blood?

Dad's been on the whisky, he just can't keep it straight
His mood's irate, like he's on a debate
With himself

I'm so sorry Marissa
I really wish that I'd had missed ya
But maybe if my Supercharged 1500 ram with the 4 wheel drive Wasn't in reverse
You'd still be with me on the next verse

Chilling with my homies
Feeling like a Rap Boy
"Rap Boy" this, "Rap Boy" that
Uhh, Rap Boy
Repping Baltimore like a Rap Boy
Rap Boy
Even though I don't know, like, uhh
Rap Boy
I'm doing my best
I'm doing my best
To be a Rap Boy, Rap Boy
Uhh
Feeling like a Rap Boy
Sitting like a Rap Boy
Hey, the world thinks I'm a Rap Boy
RAP BOY

Going to the store
Gotta get some more
Gotta get some pepper jack cheese and some kiwis, yes please, raspberries and potatoes
Mmmmmm
That is is all I have to say
All the time I have today
Oh my God all work and no play
Makes Jack a Rap Boy (Raspberry)

Do a giant rap on Applejack
I rapped a bunch of boys in my new rap pack
I even rapped a rap on little Rap Boy Belle
You know what that mean, I'm goin' straight to hell
I log onto my Tumblr rap-board like I'm the shit
I tell 'em, "Gimme fifty rapboytwis or I'ma quit"
Most Rap Boy's taste level ain't at my waist level
Make her Rap Boy till it's up in your face level
Don't do requests but I'll rap a commission
Plus my skills make your skills look like they missing
Something about Twilight, her raps looks so boy-y
I used to rap Rap Boys that looked just like Yoshi's
Now I rap ponies that have Rap Boy bodies
I made rap my living instead of a hobby (Ah)
So many Rap Boy that they form a battalion
You gon' see fillies with raps big as Rap Boys

Yeah I'm here to pillage baby
Yeah I'm here to plunder
I've got a craving big as the whole fucking down-under
And there's one thing that can sate me
And I tell you that I'm grabbin' it
Getting all up in your mamma's medicine cabinet
I just peel 'em, chew 'em up
Baby what a snack
I'm just so hooked on these bandaids that I could've had a heart attack
Oooh, that chew baby
Ooh, that firmness
Good God, Rap Boy, what I wouldn't do to earn this

Once upon a time in the magical land Equestria;
Rap Boy came down from hell to 'oust Celestia
'cause she's a bitch lock her up in Jail Hitch
Then together let rob the palace to get rich
He's Rap Boy! Not a frat boy or dat boy
Or sitting on a porta potty taking a crap boy
He's a man of his word, haven't you heard, earth turd
Or are you really telling me you think this is absurd
I got news for you; we won't take your treachery
'cause Rap Boy's the one one who gave us democracy
And we'll vote you out; without a doubt
Go ahead and pout, you won't get any clout
That's right Rap Boy is the one we want
All the mares and the stallions want to lick his cunt
Even humans too like Kim Jong-un
But rap boy's heart is reserved for Bulk Bogan

Cope, cope, seethe , you is bald
Step on a banana peel and then you fall
Need some therapy all of that baggage that you haul
They got yo butt in 4K, you had Better Call Saul
Pull up on me , gon' get clapped, boy
The case a closed casket, it's a wrap, boy
You lost up in the sauce, you need a map, boy
Little baby tired, want a nap, boy?
Beat that  up, I got 'em on the ropes
If you don't believe me you can check on snopes
You suffering on the street, that's cause you smokin' dope
Yo baby momma left you cause you smokin' dope
Yo hairline is receding' cause you smokin' dope
Grandmama praying for you but she is losing hope
Done went and wrote letter, sent it to the Pope
You asked the Engineer for beats 'n he said nope

Rap Boy, Rap Boy , yeah she want the Rap Boy 
Rap Boy, Rap Boy , yeah she want the Rap Boy 
Rap Boy, Rap Boy , yeah she  want the Rap Boy 
Rap Boy, Rap Boy, yeah she want the Rap Boy
Yes I am the Rap Boy, yeah she want the Rap Boy 
How many bitches comin' over afterwards?
Rap Boy, Rap Boy, yeah she want the Rap Boy 
Rap Boy, Rap Boy , yeah she want the Rap Boy 

BLACK MAN WITH A SHORT

Boy, I'm gonna crush you just like Troy
I'm gonna pull up in a horse
And burn your dead corpse (oh shit)


Spin it again




Lotus goin' huge, it's like, like, like
I finally got away from the wrapboy verse
It's my couch that they came on
I take care of some wrapboy friends
I was caught in a front way
Like a wrapboy in its mouth dreams
A wrapboy in the middle of a stall
Swallows most of the rest
Boy
Sick, they stink just like wrapboy, honey
Now my round now a ten and my voice full of laughter
Take it straight through the wall
When you go strike it with a fist
Ease down then you wrapboy a boy boy boy
Ease down then you wrapboy a boy boy boy boy!


(Horn honka honka)



I'm a Rap Boy, what can I say?
I like to rap almost every day
When the sun's up high or I'm in my bed
I can't stop rapping all the words in my head
I'm a Rap Boy, that's easy to see
I learned to rap when I was three
When daddy picked me up and he screamed in my face
Said "if you don't write a rap you're a big disgrace!"
So here I am now, older and bolder
I've got some chips on my shoulder
I called you granny and told her
I'm a Rap Boy card holder
I have my rappers' support
They're rapping from Phoenix, Arizona
All the way to Tacoma, Philadelphia
Atlanta, L.A
Northern California, where the girls are warm
So I can be a Rap Boy today
That's more than enough about my Rap Boy life
I gotta get home to my kids and my wife
This is where I end my Rap Boy tale
I bid you adieu and I'll say farewell!
But don't you fret, it ain't over yet
There's more raps to come in the very next set
So listen to the next part and I hope you enjoy
I'll tell you right now I'm not the only Rap Boy

This track's for Rap Boy
So stand back, boy
Papa's full of rap joy
The microphone's my rap toy
Your dad came in strong with a pocket full of beats
This is a pocket of treats
Everybody take their seats
Rap Boys, here we got a million members!
So how on Earth am I even going to be remembered?
The answer's quite clear:
You know I'm the Rap Dad!
Now that I'm on the stage
You are all my rap lads

He’s in the server, in the back
Waiting for his time, he’s lurking silent
Anxious, cool for just a moment
Rap Boy, wait a minute, you said let’s go way too fast!
Rap Boy, getting up early, feeling so empty, and going to class
Conscious of listeners judging his bars
Wishing that he could be somewhere afar
Watching the messages fly off the screen
Lyrical emptiness, wanting to scream
Rap Boy, anxious feelings welling up inside his chest
Rap Boy, wrapping up now knowing that he did his best

Rap Boy
Y’all wanna keep it hip-hop? We’ll keep it hip-hop
I gotchu
Yo
Am dat Rap Boy, coming up to destroy
Fake motherfuckers never struggled but talk hustle ploys
Acting like knights, when they're working as the stable boys
You don't need that horseshit, keep being stable, boy
‘Cuz why the hell, would you rap boy?
What kinda click do you rep, boy?
What kinda shit, you overstepped boy?
You really think that they got your back boy?
You really willing to set aside your life, for a fight, that ain’t even yours to abide by? (Fuck that)
You don’t need to hustle on the offside, for people who will never have your back and provide
They ain’t your homies where you can confide, if not to you it’s about you they’ll lie
They will hate you ‘cuz they know you are right, when you’ll leave those snakes and backstabbers behind
Where you are now, I was once among, and from the ones in there, you don’t need anyone
Your path to success has just begun, so pick the pen instead of the handgun
And if I can help, to let you have run, I’ll let you hear the word from the strong
Stop the cycle in which people die young, keep it with rap, boy, ‘cuz you deserve better, son

Slow down! Slow down! Take your time!
Life's kinda hard but you'll do just fine
Go for a walk, go travel the land
It's your friend, Rap Boy! I'll give you a hand
Might give you a cheat, might guide the way
You won't be beat, that's what I'll say
I'm not gonna lie, I was there too
If you need a little help, I'll give you a clue
The best hint is Rap Boy! I thought you knew
Share it with the world, it's not taboo
You gotta get out there, go press record
Once you experience this, you won't be bored
Hope you liked my words
Hope you found your stride
Shugnussy signing off
Not gonna say goodbye

I’m a boi, I like my toy
He tried to kill me, but he’s annoy
Me
A young ski, eat a bee
Take a pee
My little sister play the Wii
DON'T YELL AT ME
I ain’t fragile
Like a seagile
My doo doo is vile
What the fuck
Is that a duck
Swigitty bup
What is up
Brrrrrrrrrrrrr-up
Ki dup
What rhymes with dup?
Bubba-Gump
In a dump truck
Symbiotic cloomby
And swinditty clinditty
Pick up the small kitty and
Through it against the wall
Laugh until it fall
All the way to the ground
Sent that shit back to the pound
Haha - your mom has been around…
…the house cleaning
Because she’s good meaning
But I push real hard and
She’s a spinning
Ha,          winning
Listening to this crap
It means you’re sinning
Hehe
I ran out of words that rhyme
Has no meaning

I’m living life like Zack & Cody
And I get to spend it all day long with my friend, Boby
You might find this false, call it all baloney
But, I ask to find it in your heart ‘cus we are homies
(Yuh)
We can play in the Walmart, I know the manager here
He got the go-karts
Rap boys bouta go in third gear
Rippin’ through the twelve aisles
Rip our asses with tears

Fucked up in the chat listenin' SGAP (SGAP)
Fucked up in the chat bein' Rap Boy (Rap Boy)
Fucked up the chat usin' YouTube (YouTube)
Fucked up in chat bein' Busty (Lusty)
Fucked up in the chat likin' ponies (Ponies)
Fucked in the chat playing Windjam’ (Windjam’)
Fucked up in the chat and I’m poppin' off (poppn' off)
Fucked up in the chat then I’m off

Pop pop, Rap Boy, I’m a Rap Dog
Clop cloppin’ every night to a new song
Feelin’ that this beat is just the one to open up on
I’ll give you just a second, we’re at Grandma’s, put your shoes on
Chompy overconfident this dog can do a new trick
Couldn’t stop when I hear a beat that’s this sick
Diamond Dogs, underground, as I spit shit
Boston represent: how good am I? Wicked
Like to see your face as I keep pace for the whole beat
Should’ve stayed in my place in the back seat
Breaking down like dialog in DustCar #General
Ay, dios mio, el server en fuego
Hats into rings, into trees and over walls
TLC is how I found this waterfall
Wind me up and tell me that this shit’s impossible
“I thought you were on my side,” I’m just a dog after all
Cholmsky once said, “All issues are political”
Your music takes a stance even if you don’t want it to
I embrace that the waste of my time amounts to nothing
I’ll be clear, I’ll be here when you know what that means (means… means… means… means… means… means… means… means…)



Yeah it’s rap time
Bitch I don't got a house, I don't got a roof (Rap Boy)
Yuh, I don't got no friends, I don't got no shoes (Rap Boy)
Yeah I be livin by the overpass (Rap Boy)
Got a tent but don't come in when I be rippin’ ass (Rap Boy)
Yuh, I saw you grandma at the cemetery (Rap Boy)
Was like wassup but then I realized she was gettin’ buried (Rap Boy)
I didn't see you there, cause it was really crowded (Rap Boy)
But I'll be here man if you ever wanna talk about it, yuh

Wait a minute, who are you?!?

Yeahh..
R-A-P B-O-Y, R-A-P B-O-I (x4)

I just don't know what went wrong..

Yah!
Fuck off the fame, but I'm making a name
I can go hard, like I'm Breaking the Chain
I might just spark, and then burst into flames
Pinkie gave head like it's... (Uhh Yahh!)
Fuck off the fame, but I'm making a name
I can go hard, like I'm Breaking the Chain
I might just spark, and then burst into flames
Pinkie gave head like it's Pinky and Brain
Guess I don't know how to stay in my Lane
Can't be contained, I'll go insane
Already broke out in Flames
Already broke out in Flames!
Look at me flashing my fangs
Already burst like a vein
You know how we do again
Yeah, off of the top
Off of the top of the top
Off of the top of the brain
Yahhmmhmm
But I got the magic flow
I don't know, I don't know
How I am so tropical, yeah! Hmm
Pony Abstract and I am back though
Yeah, I feel so fly
Should have been a Wonderbolt, yeah


That boy, on the grind with mindset “every man for himself”
Wack boy, creator, hater, influencing for wealth
Slap boy, “Everybody knows shit grows with a thumbnail-
Trap” boy, with the pose and the gym bros, dumbbells
Too few fools giving thanks to the black boys
YouTubers making bank as a Rap Boy
And boy it’s lonely, no way-
Back, boy, alone with no mates to dis-
Tract, boy. Like Logan and Jake, you overgrown
Frat boys, you both are mistakes and overblown
Everybody wanna be a superstar fat boy
Listen up and commit to the bars, Rap Boy

David so-gap on the beat
Gonna fucking eat some sheet
Gonna eat some fucking hotdogs and some muffins
When I'm in the shower
I'm in the shower
Yeah, I'm in the shower
I'm not a Rap Boy, I'm just Lil' Fuck
I'm naked and I'm horny in the shower
In the shower

Yup.. uh I totally know what I’m doing, oh god
Who is this Rap Boy, where did they go, what did they do? Could it be you?
Hmm.. maybe unless you’re a little baby… sorry that was mean
I’m sure you're really clean, that’s the thing. Uh, yeah
So go on your quest, you know you’re the best
Put it up to the test so you can tell the rest…
That you’re the real Rap Boy
Go Rap Boy (x6)
I promise I’m not saying “rat boy” I'm saying “Rap Boy” (uh)


Okay… I’m gonna be totally honest here as I record this
I literally cannot think of a single verse
So I’m just gonna go along
My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I’ll lose myself to suicide
My my, I think we have a spy
I swing my fist you turn your face I hit the other side
I'll die, so why can't I decide?
My brain might self destruct, I’ll lose myself to suicide (Suicide yuh)
Rap Boy™
Okay. That was… not really the best
Eh, well I mean it wasn’t the WORST thing I’ve ever written
Anyways, that’s uh… enough for my cringy segment
Onto the next person

This might sound corny
But I'mma heat it up
This beat is boring (no offense)
So I'mma speed it up
Here comes a "Rap Boy"
Nah I'm a fuckin sadboy
I don't spit verses but instead I fuckin' dab, boy
Why sound so serious go eat a fuckin tabloid
Aww are you jealous or are you fuckin mad, boy? (Nah)
I ain't horny on main but I'll make that booty clap, boy
Yes I might be Asian but I'm not that good at math, boy
I'm making bags, boy
Yeah I got them racks, boy
You're just a fat boy who needs a fat nap, boy
You be eating cake around you I'm running laps, boy
You keep on bitching cuz you wish that you were that boy
You're on the defence, hah, I'm on the attack, boy
Mess with the DustCar crew you made a bad choice
 (Reprise)
Heyheyhey, I don't fuck with no DustCar, okay? I don't fuck with DustCar
Busty's for life
You fucked up my beat
I don't know how to start it again
Uhhh-

I can't read Russian, don't ask me
I can give you some advice, fuck a pony!
If I could have a horse, I would be be happy
If a horse could have me, I would be dead

When Discord reigns
And Discord’s rain is similar to Tay Zonday
Oh wait- this is my time to play!
Rap Boy is the song and I’m only here just to say
The Unicorns aren’t Captive
When we’re out and when we’re vibing 'cause
Miracles don’t choose us, we’re here to decide them
Anyway which you choose
I don’t know what the fuck is going on in this track
These lyrics don’t make any sense
It’s like I’m on crack
Unless I talk like this
Anyway, I gotta go
Gotta decide my future career as an MC AC DC Electrical Lyrical Spherical Miracle Pinnacle of Deez Nuts
Gottem!

I'm not a ghost
My blood is proof
Ketamine makes me feel like Casper
Feeling like a ghoul 8 pills I’m done
And I’m chasing cheese like a rat, boy
I'm a girl but I’m still the best Rap Boy...

Ok, kids
Sit down and let a boomer spill
I’m too legit to quit but I’m too old for the rumor mill
But the zoomers watch My Little Pony, still?
And I still spit that hot fire emoji feelin like the Hawkeye of the homies, ya know, the squid and the squad
You guys watch Rocket Power Nickelodeon?
What ever happened to the Rap Boy?
Umm, been a minute since I snapped, on the track
Back in season 2 so all the more reason to spin it back but I’m like 28 guys and it’s time to face the real world
I can’t be like “Im sorry I’m late boss, I got punched in the face last night at the pit at the 100 gecs show by an e-girl
I guess I can’t let go of 2012 though, I still get questions about YouTube messages I got back when YouTube had messages
God bless those who appreciate and don’t try to locate, Ok?
