1 ContributorRaabta English Translation LyricsThey say that for everyone in this world, God has
Made someone or the other, for each one
You meet me is a sign believe me
I am made for someone like you
They say that for everyone in this world, God has
Made someone or the other, for each one
You meet me is a sign believe me
I am made for someone like you
Some contact is therе with you
Some relation is therе with you
How should I know, what do I know
Some contact is there with you
You are my partner, so why should I worry
This is the reason to live and will die for this
They say that for everyone in this world, God has
Made someone or the other, for each one
It obliged me while going
A passing moment fulfilled my wishes
I got a view of yours, got sparkling stars
Destiny’s boats got a shore
A life for which I've craved for centuries
In your company all the prayers are for that (life)
You meet me is a sign
As if I am made for someone like you

Made someone or the other, for each one
You meet me is a sign believe me
I am made for someone like you
Some relation is there with you
Some relation is there with you
How should I know, what do I know
Some contact is there with you
You are my partner, so why should I worry
This is the reason to live and will die for this
I feel it inside
Don't know why
I feel it insideEmbed
