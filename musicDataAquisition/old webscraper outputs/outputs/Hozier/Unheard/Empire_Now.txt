Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from, one hundred years from
Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from, one hundred years from

After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
The way that things are turnin'
If it falls, I would hold on for all its worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'

Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from thе empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
Onе hundred years from, one hundred years from

The martyrs of our revolution
Their spinning caused the earth to shake
The problem brought its own solution
They power now the world we've made

After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
For all the gold or sterling
If it falls, I would hold on for all its worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'

Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from, one hundred years from1Embed
