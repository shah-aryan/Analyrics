Mh, oh yeah
A moment just passed
And I know it's hard to believe, but it could have been something
And I could have smiled your way
Maybe you’d see there's something in me that loves you

I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could’ve lived it, but I didn't take a chance
Keep it on your mind, you'll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same
'Cause life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

What if I hadn't turned around?
And I'd kept walking, and looked through your starry eyes
Well, I would have known it then
Instead of just waiting to find out if I love you

I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could've lived it, but I didn’t take the chance
Keep it on your mind, you’ll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same
Well, life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

Will you love me when tomorrow comes?
It's just another Monday, baby won’t you come with me?
And see me in a different light?
I could be your angel if you want to take a chance
Baby, if you knew me, you'd know I'll always dance
Love me like you need me, and I'll be yours, true

All that matters to me is you, babe
You’re never gonna slip away
Life is just beautiful, life is just beautiful
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days
Beautiful days
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful daysEmbed
