Spent twenty-four hours, I need more hours with you
You spent the weekend getting even, ooh
We spent the late nights making things right between us

But now it's all good, babe
Roll that Backwood, babe
And play me close

'Cause girls like you run 'round with guys like me
'Til sundown when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Girls like you love fun, and yeah, me too
What I want when I come through
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah

Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
I need a girl like you

I spent last night on the last flight to you
Took a whole day up tryna get way up, ooh
We spent the daylight tryna make things right between us
