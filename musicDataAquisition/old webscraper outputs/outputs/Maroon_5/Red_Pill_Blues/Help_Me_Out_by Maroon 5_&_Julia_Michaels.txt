I'm getting kind of over this
I need a metamorphosis
Are you awake as me?
If not, do you wanna be?

Ooh, I need some temporary savin'
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating

Help me out, 'cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need somethin' up to calm me down
Help me out, out

I don't mean to bother you
But there's somethin' that I want from you
Distract me from thinkin' too much
Loose ends all tied up with a touch

Ooh, I need some temporary savin'
Ooh, I need some, some uncomplicating
You might also like
Help me out, 'cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need somethin' up to calm me down
Help me out, out

Hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Yeah, hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out, help me out
Help me out, help me out, out

Help me out, 'cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need somethin' up to calm me down
Help me out, out

And hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When you, you need somebody to
Hey, hey, I know that there will come a day
When, when you, you need somebody to
Help you out, help me out
Help me out, help me out, out18Embed
