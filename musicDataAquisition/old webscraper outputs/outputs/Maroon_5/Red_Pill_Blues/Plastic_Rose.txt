All I gave to you
Was my heart, my keys, my bed, my home
All I gave to you
Was my time, my green, my favorite jeans, and everything you choose

Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you take all that, can you take all that?
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Oh can you take off that
And give one thing back
Woah, oh

Baby, all you gave me was
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic
How'd you make it feel like love?
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose
Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic)
How'd you make it feel like love? (make it feel like love)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose

All I asked to you
Was to prove to me that you were real
All I need from you
Was the pose, the breath, the sun, and life
Something I can feel

Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you fake all that, can you fake all that?
Tell me how, how, how, how, how, how, how
Can you fake all that?
'Cause when I look back
Woah, oh

Baby, all you gave me was
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic
How'd you make it feel like love?
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose
Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic)
How'd you make it feel like love? (make it feel like love)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose

Woah
You were something beautiful, I know
I wonder why our love could never grow
But you just couldn't hide it anymore, anymore

Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic)
How'd you make it feel like love?
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose (oh)
Baby, all you gave me was (all you gave me was)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic, plastic (plastic, plastic, yeah)
How'd you make it feel like love? (make it feel like love)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic rose (oh)
Plastic rose (yeah)
Baby, all you gave me was a plastic roseEmbed
