All these angels in the sky (In the sky)
I know they can see the pain between my eyes (Between my eyes)
I been, I been rolling high (Rolling high)
Eyes low sippin', I don't need advice (I don't need advice)
Ayy, not afraid to die (Afraid to die)
Baby, you know that I'm not afraid to die (Afraid to die)
Ayy, not afraid to die (Afraid to die)
Baby, you know that I'm not afraid to die, aye (Afraid to die)

When I'm low, when I cry (When I cry)
Sippin' purpose, she know how to work it
I got love for the bitch (yeah), ayy when I'm up doing bad
She gon' get me shit (yeah), aye, get a grip, get a grip, aye
On some angels in the sky, yeah (In the sky)
Bus is in the way but I'm not afraid to die, yeah (Afraid to die)
I'ma see the way, this is more than just a phase (Phase)
It won't fade away, this is more than just a haze
Yeah, I know that-

All these angels in the sky (In the sky)
I know they can see the pain between my eyes (Between my eyes)
I been, I been rolling high (Rolling high)
Eyes low sippin', I don't need advice (I don't need advice)
Ayy, not afraid to die (Afraid to die)
Baby, you know that I'm not afraid to die (Afraid to die)
Ayy, not afraid to die (Afraid to die)
Baby, you know that I'm not afraid to die, aye (Afraid to die)You might also likeEmbed
