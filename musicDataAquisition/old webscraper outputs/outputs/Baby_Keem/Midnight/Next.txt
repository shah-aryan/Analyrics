I'mma do her how I did my ex, yeah
I'mma fuck her in the whip and I won't send a text, yeah
I'mma fuck and do the dash, do the dip and next, yeah
I'mma fuck her, do the dash, do the dip, next, uh

She say I'm a star, I might have to next her
I can't even use my real phone when I text her
Said she love me 'cause the way I apply pressure
Said she love me 'cause she think that I can dress, eh
I got hoes, I won't even text back, aye
Don't trip over that, bitch I do not flex that
Bitches acting like I'm famous and I do not stress that
Watch me flip a hundred thousand, tap the bank and check that, ah

I'mma do her how I did my ex, yeah
I'mma fuck her in the whip and I won't send a text, yeah
I'mma fuck and do the dash, do the dip and next, yeah
I'mma fuck her, do the dash, do the dip, next, uhYou might also likeEmbed
