5 Contributors50 Habits Lyrics
She so flirty (Woah, woah woah)
Ooh, baby, you dirty (Woah)
To my mans (Mans)
Then I do my dance (Do my dance)
Ten racks to my mans (Mans)
Gucci on my friends (Friends)
Ooh, she so flirty (flirty)
Ooh, baby, you dirty

I'm not very average to you
Savage to you
Show my talents to you (Yeah)
I'm not very average to you
Savage to you
Show my talents to you (Woah, woah woah)

Yeah, you did me wrong but I still wish you well
You got fifty habits don't think I can't tell
You got thotty habits I can really tell
Why you take my heart and leave me on the trail
But you not just any hoe
You still miss me though
You still get me though
Now I'm making money
Yeah, I'm getting dough
My life moving fast
Your life moving slow, woah
You might also like
She so flirty
Ooh, baby, you dirty
To my mans
Then I do my dance
Ten racks to my mans
Gucci on my friends
Ooh, she so flirty
Ooh, baby, you dirty

I'm not very average to you
Savage to you
Show my talents to you (Yeah)
I'm not very average to you
Savage to you
Show my talents to youEmbed
