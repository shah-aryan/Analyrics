13 ContributorsLocked In Lyrics
How to find a new ho?
I ran out of options
You ain't gotta take it there
All you do is pop shit
All your niggas told on you, you don't even pop shit
Get the bag on touchdown, I like playing offense

All my places locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
Locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in

She fuck up a price tag, that my lil' woah-woah
Pick it up, it ain't fair
Get it then I go-go
Niggas try to hit a stain, but they moving so slow
Wylin' at a red light
Tinted so they won't know
Oh baby, you stupid bad, know that bae
In your bag, know that bae
Put your pass on roller skates
Put your last on roller skates
She got a little attitude
You swear you so classy
I don't wanna leave her lone
Cause the pussy taste like candy
You might also like
How to find a new ho?
I ran out of options
You ain't gotta take it there
All you do is pop shit
All your niggas told on you, you don't even pop shit
Get the bag on touchdown, I like playing offense

All my places locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
Locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked in
They don't go nowhere, they locked inEmbed
