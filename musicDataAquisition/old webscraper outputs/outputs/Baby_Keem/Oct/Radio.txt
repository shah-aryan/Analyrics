I kiss my foreign in the phantom while I'm on the road
I leave my foreign 'cause I'll have some, rather on my own
I think I'd rather get no platinum while I gotta go, I'm like magic throw
While I'm on my monster flow I get it when i want to though
Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
I got lots of flows, I got stable bitches living for the foreign
Know a foreign, give it when I want it, baby, call it foreign goals
I take a shopping dorm, baby, these are foreign clothes
Get it anyway I want it
I got lots of foеs, can you bring a friend?
Baby bring a friend now take that shit again, again

I won't fall in love just let me take it for a spin
Don't get lots of her so you are irrelevant
I got lots of guap I spend it for the hell of it
And I ain't feel well, in a while i hit a bell equip
Y'all see me hanging up the roof, i'm balling on a bit
I see no lies, so tell the truth or make me tell a bit
Most of this niggas, they some gruesome comma dealer shit
Come watch me rub my wrist and VV, yes, it's killing shit

Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
I got lots of flows, I got stable bitches living for the foreign
Know a foreign, give it when I want it, baby, call it foreign goals
I take a shopping dorm, baby, these are foreign clothes
Get it anyway I want it
I got lots of foes, can you bring a friend?
Baby bring a friend now take that shit again, again

This shit is way too complicated
Baby i'm just glad i made it
Got my foreign with the fendi
And i'm balling on a paycheck
Six zeros that's the paycheck
While i'm rolling in a maybach
I'll seat back and let the day pass
I heal oscar on the way back
I remember when i any many boy used to say that
I ain't tripping off this itty bitty boys i know she come back
Had to hit them with a comeback
Niggas silly with a one track
I bet all my phony exes tryna hit me with the comeback
I kiss my foreign in the phantom while I'm on the road
I leave my foreign 'cause I'll have some, rather on my own
I think I'd rather get no platinum while I gotta go, I'm like magic throw
While I'm on my monster flow I get it when i want to though
Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
Don't let no one control me I'm like Adió
I got lots of flows, I got stable bitches living for the foreign
Know a foreign, give it when I want it, baby, call it foreign goals
I take a shopping dorm, baby, these are foreign clothes
Get it anyway I want it
I got lots of foes, can you bring a friend?
Baby bring a friend now take that shit again, again
