She wanted , yeah, and she took a sip, yeah

They don't really fuck with me the way they used to, damn
Guess I got used to it, guess I'm useful, damn
And she told me she love me but she test me, say she boring things, wow
And I had told my family that I'm movin' on to better things, yeah, 'cause
'Cause she don't really love me like she used to
And I don't feel the pressure like I used to
And all these fake niggas wanna use me
I guess a young nigga lookin' useful

She rollin' 
She wanted to flip, I got it legit, yeah
