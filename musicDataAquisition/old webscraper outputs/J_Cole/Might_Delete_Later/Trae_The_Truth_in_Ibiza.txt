Yeah
Nigga done got spoiled off these fuckin' PJ’s
I'm not—, It's not like I’m too good to fly commercial, that shit just—
It's a hassle at this point, you know what I mean?
Yeah

At a hundred degrees, I freeze the temp
Got my grip and I never proceed to slip
Feel the weight like I just had my Caesar clipped
Got a family to feed, I squeeze the clip
Walk in front of the judge and plead the fifth
I'm a legend but it ain't no need for myth
Better get you a visa, he's a trip
I had Trae The Truth in Ibiza lit

Niggas ain't 'bout to outwork me
Go to sleep late, still wakin' up early
Look at my belly, I’m hungry
Y’all niggas desperatе and thirsty
You can't even tell thеre’s a difference
Hungry is when you're relentless
Even when one of your idols look dead in your face and he tell you, "You can't" and you know that he meant it
But when you Cole, you attempt it
Come, let me show you a template
I had to grow out the concrete
I had to stroll through the trenches, uh
I had to stroll through the trenches
You might also like
At a hundred degrees, I freeze the temp (Temp)
Got my grip and I never proceed to slip (Slip)
Feel the weight like I just had my Caesar clipped (Clipped)
Got a family to feed, I squeeze the clip
Walk in front of a judge and plead the fifth
I'm a legend but it ain’t no need for myth
Better get you a visa, he's a trip
I had Trae The Truth in Ibiza lit
I had Trae The Truth in Ibiza lit
Yeah, that's my nigga
I had Trae The Truth in Ibiza lit

I can't do edibles
My head is spinnin' too much
Fell off the pedestal
And I'm never gettin' back up
Done tryna to be perfect, that shit is exhausting
An infinite force that nitpicking niggas get lost in
I'm scribbilin' thoughts, my pencil is sharpening
Trust in my pen, been tryna limit the crossing
The best part of makin' this cake is lickin' the frosting
And Barry been sayin' he love when I spit like I'm dark skin
And you know what he mean
I got a thirty-four waist
I had a forty jeans
Somehow I still got too big for my britches and tore the seams
There go my Achilles heel
Been tryna do everything
Thank God for my nigga Ib
What would I do with no team?
I wouldn't do anything
I would just sit on this music and hold it
Waiting for some perfect moment
Wondering why it ain't came
Meanwhile the world done changed
Suddenly songs I was loving last year don't feel the same
Somebody feel my pain
Please, somebody say I changed
All of these years done passed, I hope I ain't still the same
All of these songs I'm on, ain't nobody kill Jermaine
Isn't that rather strange?
I wrote a number of bad refrains
But isn't that life, dude?
Make a few hits but you gotta live with the strikes too
Instead of pretending I'm some incredible nigga, just let 'em hear all of it
The good, the bad, the ugly, the strong, the weak, it's me
The nigga that thought of it
All the portrayals of anything different or fraudulent
You wanna tap into your greatness, well this is the starter kit
The Fall Off, how many these bullets can fit in the cartridges
I'm lettin' 'em off on intentions to rip through your cartilage
My nigga just told me, "You trippin' for thinkin' of callin' quits,"
No lie
God is good, forreal
I'm just sittin' here askin' myself
The fuck was I even doin' here?
Fresh out the hospital bed, one to the back
Arm in a sling
And in the same breath, I'm in Ibiza
I ain't never fathomed seeing another side of this shit
I know you felt the same
Hell, I remember we used to pray for it, but hell
Look at ya', bro
People speak greatness these days when the name get mentioned
But what is greatness?
Nah, nigga we lit
Iconic, haha
It ain't over 'til we tap out
Cole, you better make these niggas feel you
We done seen 'em come
We done seen 'em go
From the Come Up to the Fall Off
And even when we fall off, we don't fall off, niggaEmbed
